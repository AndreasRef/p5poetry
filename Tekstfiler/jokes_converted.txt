A doctor, an architect, and a computer scientist were arguing about
whose profession was the oldest. In the course of their arguments,
they got all the way back to the Garden of Eden, whereupon the doctor
said, "The medical profession is clearly the oldest, because Eve was
made from Adam's rib, as the story goes, and that was a simply
incredible surgical feat."
The architect did not agree. He said, "But if you look at the Garden
itself, in the beginning there was chaos and void, and out of that,
the Garden and the world were created. So God must have been
an architect."
The computer scientist, who had listened to all of this said,

A novel approach is to remove all power from the system, which removes
most system overhead so that resources can be fully devoted to doing
nothing. Benchmarks on this technique are promising; tremendous
amounts of nothing can be produced in this manner. Certain hardware
limitations can limit the speed of this method, especially in
the larger systems which require a more involved & less efficient
power-down sequence.
An alternate approach is to pull the main breaker for the building,
which seems to provide even more nothing, but in truth has bugs in it,
since it usually inhibits the systems which keep the beer cool.

to City upon which carts and coaches pass, and alongside which inns
have come to be built to stave off Hunger, Thirst and Weariness.

what Freight was too.

   Here in Kentucky, we're in the middle of deer hunting season, which
means that the woods are full of people armed with weapons with a higher
caliber than their IQ. Which brings to mind the story of the man who took
his wife deer hunting (apologies to those who may be offended by the sexism
- actually female deer hunters are no stupider than males). Anyway, they
decided to split up to improve their chances of finding a deer. The man
explained to his wife that the woods were full of dishonest hunters who
might try to claim her deer if she managed to kill one. In case this
happened, she should fire her rifle into the air three times, to summon
him for assistance. They went their separate ways, and soon he heard a
shot, followed by three quick shots. He followed the direction of the
sound, and found his wife holding a man at gunpoint. She said "It was
just like you told me, I killed this deer fair and square and this man
says its his." The husband pointed his rifle at the stranger, who placed
his hands in the air and said "She's welcome to keep it, I would just like
to get my saddle back."

Q:Why did the pervert cross the road?

     The other day this guy came up to me and asked if I wanted to buy his
old '57 Chevy convertible. I thought it was a pretty good looking car and
so I offered him 50 female pigs and 50 male deer.

    The guy looked at me kind of crazy like and started to mutter under
his breath. I asked him what's the matter, don't you want a hundred sows
and bucks?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roses are red,
And ready for plucking,
She's fifteen,
And ready for ...
High school.

     So this lady walks into a bar carrying a duck under her arm. A drunk
at the bar looks up and says, "That's the ugliest pig I ever saw!". The

drunk says, "I was talking to the duck."

     There were two morons that wanted to go hunting. They went out into the
woods and after a while decided to split up. One went one way and the other
went another way. As this joke would have it, one of the morons shot the
other moron by mistake. The moron that shot his friend was very upset and
so he took the friend to the hospital. When he saw the doctor, he asked how
his friend was doing and if he was going to live. The doctor replied, "He
would have been fine if you hadn't have gutted him first."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     This man walked into the bar and said to the bartender, "Let me tell
you this joke about dumb jocks." The bartender replied, "Listen, bud, I
don't think that would be a good idea. See those two guys over in the
corner booth? They used to play for the Dallas Cowboys. And those three
guys at the end of the bar used to wrestle professionally. Also, I used
to play professional hockey." The man then replied, "Forget it, I don't
have time to explain it to all six of you."

     One day, a guy comes into a doctor's office and says, "Doc, I want it to
grow". So the doc says, "Here, take three of these a day," and gives the guy
a bottle of pills.

     An hour later, another guy comes in and he wants it to grow too. The doc
says, "Take 3 of these a day." "No, I'll take 6!" and the guy leaves.

     Then a cowboy comes in: He wants the same. He's told to take 3 but says,
"Nah, I'll take 24!" and leaves.

     The next day all three guys come into the office.

     1st: "Doc, Doc, it's down to my ankles!"

     2nd: "Doc, Doc, it's draggin' an inch behingd me!"

     Cowboy: "Yeeee-Haaah!"

     This old man rambles into a bar and shuffles up to the counter. He leans
over the counter and says to the bartender "I'll gouge my eye out for $25."
The bartender says, "I'm game," so the old man pops out a fake eye with a big
grim and takes the $25. Then he says, "For $50 I'll bite my other eye." The
bartender then says, "You must have at least one good eye, so I'm in." So the
old man pulls out his dentures and moves them in a biting motion over his
other eye and takes the money. The old man then says "For ..." The bartender
cuts in and says, "I'm not going to pay you to do anything else." So the old
man shuffles of to the back room. About thirty minutes later he comes back up
to the bartender and says, "I'm going to give you a chance to get your money
back. I'll bet you $100 That I can pee into a shot glass on one end of the bar
from the other end of the bar." The Bartender thinks this over and agrees to
it. So the bartender puts a shotglass at one end and the old man stands up on
the other end a pulls it out and starts peeing all over the bar, stools, and
even the bartender. The bartender jumps up for joy knowing that he has just
won his hundred when he notices the old man laughing. He asks the old man why
he is laughing and the old man says, "I just bet two men in the back $500 that
I could pee all over you and the bar and have you like it."

from his mother's bedroom. He hastily peeked through the keyhole and saw his
mother lying on the bed, naked, rubbing herself and saying "I need a man,
God, I need a man!"

     The boy saw this ritual several times, until one day he peeked through

          This text ACTUALLY came out of an IBM service database.
          Of course it's referring to the rubber ball inside a
          computer mouse ...

Abstract: MOUSE BALLS NOW AVAILABLE AS FRU (Field Replacement Unit)

Text: Mouse Balls are now available as a FRU. If a mouse fails to
operate or should perform erratically, it may be in need of ball
replacement. Because of the delicate nature of this procedure,
replacement of mouse balls should be attempted by trained personnel
only.

Before ordering, determine type of mouse balls required by examining
the underside of each mouse. Domestic balls will be larger and harder
than foreign balls. Ball removal procedures differ, depending upon
manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the
pop-off method and domestic balls replaced using the twist-off
method. Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive, however,
excessive handling can result in sudden discharge.

Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be used
immediately.

It is recommended that each servicer have a pair of balls for
maintaining optimum customer satisfaction and that any customer
missing his balls should suspect local personnel of removing these
necessary functional items.

During a recess in the proceedings, three delegates to an international
agriculture convention sat down for cocktails, and before long, they began
to discuss methods for driving their wives wild.

The French delegate volunteered that he always picked a few roses from the
garden, spread the petals on his wife's body, then gently blew them off
before making love.

The Englishman declared that before making love to his wife, he would
massage her with hot oil.

The two Europeans then turned to the Texan and asked him his secret.
"Well," he said, "after the wife and I get it on, I hop outta bed and
wipe my dick on the curtains. That, gents, drives her wild!"

Three grade-school children learned how to swear from their friends at
school. Thinking highly of their accomplishment, they decided to try it
out at home, choosing the next morning's breakfast to show off their newly
acquired skill. As they sit down at the breakfast table, their mother
turns to the oldest child and asks what he wants for breakfast.

"Aw, hell, I think I'll have some damn cheerios," he replies, whereupon
mother whacks him a good one upside the head. Somewhat irritated, she
turns to the next child and asks him what he wants.

"Ah, hell, I'll have some of them f**king cheerios, too," is his answer,
whereupon he also gets whacked dizzy. In utter disgust, the mother turns
to the youngest child and repeats her question in a clearly angry tone of
voice.

The child replied "I sure as hell ain't going to have them f***ing
cheerios!"

hit, I waded outside and, for safety, the neighbor's son and I ended up on

A guy walks into a bar where he has heard that the bartender is keeping a
horse in back. Walking up to the bar, he asks what the bartender would
give him if he were able to go back to the horse and make it laugh.  The
bartender offers 100 bucks. The guy says o.k., and walks back to the horse
and whispers in its ear. Suddenly the horse starts laughing in an uproar.
The man colects his money and leaves. A week later, the man shows up again
and asks the bartender what he'd pay if he could make the horse cry? This
time the bartender is thinking he's got a sure win and bets 1000 bucks.
Once agin the man walks back to the horse and a few minutes later, the
horse is crying! The bartender pays up, but asks "You got to tell me what
happened." The man says, "Well, the first time, I told your horse that my
cock was bigger than his. The second time, I showed him."

A priest wanted to raise money for the church. He was told that there was a
fortune in horse rasing, so he decided to purchase a horse and enter it in
a race. However, at an auction, the going price for a horse was so steep
that he decided to buy a donkey and race it. To his surprise, the donkey
came in third. The next day the racing sheet carried the headline, "PRIEST'S
ASS SHOWS." The priest was pleased with the donkey and entered it in another
race. This time it won. The paper reported, "PRIEST'S ASS OUT IN FRONT." The
bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the priest
not to enter the donkey in any more races. The paper read, "BISHOP SCRATCHES
PRIEST'S ASS." This was just too much for the bishop, so he ordered the
priest to get rid of the donkey. The priest gave the donkey to a nun at a
nearby convent and the headline read, "NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN." The bishop
fainted. He informed the nun that she would have to dispose of the donkey.
She sold it to a farmer for $10 and the newspaper reported, "NUN PEDDLES ASS
FOR TEN BUCKS." They buried the bishop the next day.

A priest, a minister and a rabbi all died at the same time and met at the
Pearly Gates. St. Peter stood before the locked gates and looked upon them
sternly. "I have been reviewing your lives," St. Peter began, "You've all
done a remarkable job leading exemplary lives. However, before I can allow
any of you to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, you each must answer one ques-
tion." Peter turned towards the priest, "Father, when does life begin?"
The priest proudly replied, "At the moment of conception!" Consulting his
answer sheet, St. Peter said, "You've answered according to your faith.
You may now enter the Kingdom of Heaven." As the priest disappeared through
the Pearly Gates, St. Peter turned to the minister. "When does life begin?"
The minister, without hesitation proclaimed, "When the head leaves the birth
canal!" Peter once again checked his list, saying, "You've answered accord-
ing to your faith. You may now enter the Kingdom of Heaven." As the minister
disappeared through the Pearly Gates, St. Peter turned to the rabbi. "So,
Rabbi, when does life begin?" The rabbi thought carefully, stroked his
beard, and replied, "When the dog dies and the kids leave home."

to determine ethnic variation in olfactory tolerance. The three were locked
into a well-heated pigpen with four pigs who had been fed a steady diet of
All-Bran and Ex-Lax. After thirty minutes, the german could take it no longer
and crawled, gasping for breath, from the pig-pen. Two hours later the
polack left the pig-pen, a curious shade of chartreuse, and collapsed. Ten
more minutes passed before the pigs ran out begging for mercy ...

After many years of study, two orthodox rabbanical students graduated from
the seminary, and were told to get black suits and go into the world. One
said that his uncle Pincus, the tailor, would give them a great deal, so
they went to see him. After picking up their suits, the two new rabbis walked
down the street, arguing about the color of their suits. The first rabbi said
the suits were navy; the second said no they were black. That's when they saw
a nun waiting at a bus stop. They ran up behind the nuns to compare colors of
clothing. Lo and behold, their suits were navy! "How do you like that, Pincus
fucked us!" said one rabbi. The nun turned around, saying, "I didn't know you
could speak Latin!"

Two tourists, a Pole and Czechoslovakian, were visiting Yellowstone National
Park. Their first night, two huge bears wandered into their campsite and ate
the two hapless tourists. The park rangers set out immediately to find these
killer bears. Finally, they cornered two bears, a male and a female, which
they thought might have been responsible. "What do you think we ought to do
with them?" asked the first ranger. "Well," the second ranger replied, "I
figure we should cut the bears open. If we find the people inside, we know
we've got our killer bears." Whereupon, the first ranger began to cut the
female bear, and sure enough he found the remains of the Pole. "Any luck?"
he called out to his partner. "Yep," said the other. "The Czech is in the
male."

A jewish guy walked into a bar, sat down next to a chinese guy, had two
drinks, and punched the chinese guy in the nose. "What that for?" asked the
chinese guy. "That's for bombing Pearl Harbor," said the Jew. "You idiot,"
said the chinese guy, "JAPANESE bomb Pearl Harbor - NOT Chinese!" "Ah,"
said the jewish guy, "Chinese, japanese, it's all the same." So the chinese
guy finished his drink and punched the jewish guy in the nose. "What was
THAT for?" asked the jewish guy. "That for sinking Titanic," said the chinese
guy. "You moron," said the jewish guy, "the Titanic was sunk by an iceberg!"
"Ah so," said the chinese guy, "Iceberg, Greenberg, it all same!"

Two canadians decide to go duck hunting so they get up early one morning,
and go off to the swamps with their red hats, duck calls, and their trusty
hunting dog. Even with all conditions favorable for a good day, by day's end
they headed home without a single duck! The first canadian said "Do you
think that maybe the duck calls didn't work?" The second replied, "No, the
duck calls were fine. I think we weren't throwing the dog high enough!"

Three yuppers were out in the forest hunting. They hadn't had much luck and
were about ready to shoot anything. One yupper forced his way through some
bushes and said, "Hey! I found some deer tracks!" The second yupper nudged
him to the side and said, "You dummy, those aren't deer tracks, those are
bear tracks!" So, the third yupper shoved his way in, put his head down
real close to the tracks to see what they were, and was run over by a train.

The Scots pray on the Sabbath, and on their neighbors; the Irish don't know

Two yuppers were hunting in the woods. It had been a long and unproductive
day. As the hunters walked into a sunny clearing, Sven spied a beautiful,
and well-endowed, coed sunbathing in the nude. She noticed the hunters,
winked, and waved them over. "Ole," Sven stammered, "I think she wants us
to screw her!" Ole replied "I'm game." So Sven shot him.

A team of detectives arrived at the business executive's New York penthouse
apartment and were admitted by the butler. "Mr. James," one told the busi-
nessman, "we have some good news and some bad news about your missing wife."
"You'd better give me the bad news first," said Mr. James. "We found her
floating face down in the East River this afternoon with eight large lob-
sters clinging to her body." "Oh, poor Sandra," the man sighed, "What's
the good news?" "We're sending her back out in the morning."

Rock Hudson?"

Two newfies were off on their annual trip to the Canadian Rockies to bag a
moose. As the seaplane landed on a lake in a remote area, the pilot said,
"I'll be back in one week to pick you up. But only one moose, please."
A week later, when he returned to the lake, the pilot found the hunters
proudly standing beside two moose. "I told you guys only one moose!" the
furious flier screamed. "There's no way the plane can take off with that
much weight!" "You're just a chicken," one hunter said. "We killed two
moose last year and that pilot wasn't afraid to take off," said the other
newfie. Stung by the suggestion of cowardice, the pilot reconsidered.
"Alright, if you did it last year, I guess we can try it." So they loaded
up and the pilot taxied to the far end of the lake to begin his take-off.
The plane bounced across the water as it strained to get airborne, but the
overloaded aircraft finally ran out of space and crashed into the trees.
Some time later, the newfies regained consciousness. "Where are we?" one
asked. His friend looked around at the scattered debris, then back at the
edge of the lake, and replied, "Oh, I guess about a hundred yards further
than last year."

A New Jersey suburbonite had just motored through the Lincoln Tunnel into

With the sun beginning to rise, the cabin of the jetliner was suddenly
illuminated. "Who turned on the fucking lights?" a male passenger, who had
been surly since boarding, snarled at a stewardess. The girl had had enough
of this particular character. "These are the breakfast lights, sir," she
answered with forced sweetness. "The fucking lights are much dimmer, and
you snored right through them."

                 sex.
3. Hallway sex - As your relationship has matured you walk down the hall and
                 say "Fuck you".

An attractive young secretary in her first week on the job got some friendly
advice about the office Romeo from the more matronly office workers. "Watch
out for 'Tiny' ... Stay away from 'Tiny'," they warned her. After a few weeks
on the job, two of the older secretaries cornered her in the copy room. "I
see you worked after hours with Tiny last night," one began. "Did Tiny make
any moves on you when you were alone?" the other asked. The pretty young
secretary didn't know quite what to say. She replied that she had a most
pleasant evening, and she didn't know why everyone kept calling him
'Tiny'. "Oh, I guess you didn't find out last night after all," one of
the older women laughed. "You see, he has a tatto on the side of his penis
that says 'Tiny'." "Then we must be talking about two different people,"
the young secretary rplied, "The man I was with has a tatoo that says
Ticonderoga, NY."

Three elderly women, recently transplanted from the Northeast to a Florida
retirement community, were getting acquainted at poolside. Inevitably, their
conversation turned to children. "My son is the most successful doctor on
Park Avenue," announced Mrs. Cohen. Not to be outdone, Mrs. Goldsteinthe
remarked, "My son is the most successful lawyer on Wall Street." Mrs. Smith
remained conspicuously silent. Sensing easier game, Mrs. Cohen inquired,
"And you, dear, do you have a son?" "And is he a professional?" demanded
Mrs. Goldstein. "Well, not exactly," answered Mrs. Smith, "Actually, he's
a plumber. And not only that, he's gay." Beaming, one of the poor woman's
interrogators offered consolation: "Ah, he's not doing so well ..." This
time it was the Mrs. Smith smiled. "He's not doing too badly," she explained.
"He goes out with the most successful doctor on Park Avenue and the most
successful lawyer on Wall Street ..."

   POLITICAL SPEECH OF A LADY DELEGATE TO A NATIONAL POLITICAL CONVENTION

Dear Lady Delegates:

     We must have what the men have. It may not be very long, But we mean
to have it. If we can't have it without friction, then we will have it with
friction. If we can't get it through organization, then we will get it
through combination or both, if necessary.

     We refuse to be poked in the gallery any longer, and insist on being
layed on the floor in the house. We are willing to look up to the men, but
we don't always want to hold up our ends and show our possibilities when-
ever anything arises that will meet our expectations. Nothing that comes
will be too hard for us.

     We women have always been interested in good movements and will take
any load given us. We are still willing to work under men that have been
over us in the past, even to the point of exhaustion if necessary. But,
we are beginning to become disgusted with failings and short comings.

     Never when anything arose that required our presence and attention
have we failed to come again and again if the occasion required it. But,
all too often have our hopes and striving been met with feeble performances
which have left us disappointed and unsatisfied.

     How often have our efforts to push our ends been met with the cry,
"Down with petticoats"? Now I say, "Up with the petticoats and down with
the pants!" As long as we women are split up the way we are the men will
always be on top.

     Thank you friends.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The golfer had lost his ball and was a little annoyed with his caddy: "Why

     A man suspects his wife of cheating on him, so he goes to the pet store
to shop for a parrot. He sees quite an assortment for sale for $500 to $1000,
but that's a bit more than he want to spend, so he's delighted to come across
one in the corner for sale for $29.95. "How come that one's so cheap," he
asks the clerk. "To tell you the truth, his dick is oversized and it embar-
rasses the customers." The husband buys the bird anyway, and installs it on
a perch right over the bed. The next day the first thing he does after coming
home form work is to rush upstairs ... "Well, what happened today?" he
demanded of the bird. "Well, the milkman came, and your wife told him to
come into the bedroom, and they took off their clothes and got into bed."
"So what happened next," screamed the husband. "I don't know," says the
parrot, "My dick got hard and I fell off my perch!"

Jesus and Moses went out to play golf one day. Moses tees off on the first
hole, and hits a beautiful 250-yard drive right in the middle of the fairway.
Jesus steps up, and hits a worm-burner about 50 yards. Moses started to
laugh, but then a mouse picked up the ball and ran down the fairway. A hawk
swooped down from the sky, picked up the mouse, flew over the green, and
dropped the mouse. The mouse dropped the ball, and the ball rolled right in
the cup. Moses turned to Jesus and says, "Are you gonna play golf or just
screw around?"

Did you hear about Bill and Joe, the twin brothers?

Bill was married and Joe was single. The single brother, Joe, was the proud
owner of a dilapidated old row boat. It so happened that Bill's wife died on
the same day that Joe's boat filled with water and sank. A few days later
a kindly old lady met Joe on the street and mistook him for his brother Bill.
She said, "Oh, Mr. Smith, I was sorry to hear of your great loss. You must
feel terrible."

Joe spoke up saying, "I'm not a bit sorry. She was a rotten old thing right
from the start. Her bottom was all chewed up, she smelled of old fish and the
first time I got into her she drank water faster than anything I ever saw.
She had a bad crack and a pretty bad hole in her front, and the hole kept
getting bigger every time I used her. It got so I could handle her all right,
but when anyone else used her, she leaked like everything. But what really
finished her was the four guys looking for a good time. They asked me if I
would rent her to them. I warned them that she wasn't too hot, but they
could take a crack at her anyway. The result was the crazy fools tried to
get into her all at once and it was too much for her and she cracked up the
middle ..."

Before he could finish the old lady fainted.

FROM: B.H.

SUBJECT: Chauvinist from Hell!

Well, I heard this joke from a rather drunk friend of mine. The clincher
is, he told it in front of his wife. Not a pretty sight...

     God created the world. He was lonely, and so he created the
     birds, the animals, and the fishes. He was still lonely, and
     so he created two men. When he finished, he sat back and
     sighed satisfactorily. A timid angel raised his hand and
     said, "God, there is just one problem. You have created two
     men. They cannot reproduce." God thought about the problem
     for a moment, scratched his chin, and replied, "You're right.
     Give the dumb one a cunt."

I just about fell over!

"doing the laundry" so their kid's wouldn't know what was up. One day the
man came home from work and said to his wife, "Honey, let's do some laundry."
"Not now," she said, "I've had a hard day and I just wanna watch a little
t.v." "OK," he says, "I'm gonna go take a nap." Time passed and the missus
decided that a little whoopee might be just the thing so she joined her hubby
in the bedroom. "I've changed my mind, let's do some laundry " she said.
"Sorry," said the husband, "but I just had a small load, so I did it by
hand."

money. One day the man went out to repair a hole in the roof of the stable.
"I need a ladder," he said to his wife. "Get the ladder, get the ladder," she

repeated as she ran back to the toolshed. The guy soon got down to work and
was hammering away when he hit himself squarely on the thumb. "Fuck!" he
screamed. His wife bobbed away saying, "Get the bag, get the bag!"

There were three dogs sitting at the pound and each had an interesting story
about why they were there and what they thought would happen to them.

Pit-Bull: The family next door had a nine month old baby and it was always
crying - crying so much it was driving its parents crazy, driving my owner
crazy, driving ME crazy - everyone! So, one day, they left the back door open
and I sneaked in and bit it's arm off. I heard later that it died on the way
to the hospital.

"So," asked the the doberman, "what do you think will happen to you?"

"I guess I'll get the gas chamber," replied the pit-bull.

Doberman: The damned postman always sprays me with mace. It makes my eyes
water like crazy, makes me sneeze and I can't sleep all afternoon. One day,
another postman came to the house, but he didn't know I existed, so I chewed
his leg off. Apparently he died the next day at the hospital.

"So," asked the great dane, "what do you think will happen to you?"

"I guess I'll get the gas chamber," replied the doberman.

Great Dane: My master is a gorgeous 25 year old woman. One day I was lonely
and was looking for her. But I couldn't find her. So, I went upstairs and I
found her kneeling on the floor, washing out the bath tub. She had no clothes
on and the sight made me lose control. I sneaked up behind her and ...

"So," interrupted the other two, "what do you think will happen to you?"

"I guess I'm here to get my nails cut," grinned the great dane ...

There was a Pole who was stranded at sea. He saw a bottle floating and picked
it up. When he opened it, a Genie popped out, "I have been trapped in that
bottle for a thousand years! I will grant you three wishes for freeing me!"
The Pole considered it and requested, "I would like to have the Mongol hoards
come out of the East and sack, pillage and destroy Warsaw." The genie con-
sidered it, and clapped his hands. "It is done," he said. The Pole said, "My
second wish is to have the Mongol hoards come out of the East and sack,
pillage and destroy Warsaw." The Genie looked puzzled, but clapped his
hands. "It is done," he said. The Pole said, "My third wish is..." The
Genie cut him off, "...to have the Mongol hoards come out of the East and
sack, pillage and destroy Warsaw?" "Yes," agreed the pole. The Genie clapped
his hands, and said, "It is done. I am now free to leave, but I must know
before I go. Why did you want the Mongol hoards to come out of the East and
sack pillage and destroy Warsaw?" "Because," said the Pole, "In order for
the Mongol hoards to come out of the East three times and sack pillage and
destroy Warsaw, they'd have to cross Russia SIX times!"

he ralized that he had eaten all of the peanuts. When the woman returned
from the kitchen he began to appologize by saying that he was extremely

One day the Pope became very sick. All the cardinals are very concerned since
he looked like he would not last long. They called in a number of doctors and
none of them could help. Finally, they called for the best doctor in Rome,
who told them,  "There is only one hope for him, but you are not going to
like it." The cardinals said, "Anything, tell us and we will do it!" So the
Doctor explained, "The only way that he will live is if he has sex with a
woman."  A gasp went up from the cardinals and then a murmuring. But they
agreed to tell the Pope. They explained the situation and the Pope (he was
Italian) said, "Wella, thera musta be three condiziones. Firsta, she musta
be blind so she canna see nothing." The cardinals nodded in agreement.
"Nexta," the Pope continued, "she musta be deff so she canna hear nothing."
They all agreed and said, "And what, Your Holiness, is the third condition?"
"The thirda condizione," said the Pope, "isa thata she musta have biga tits."

Three guys, an Italian, a Jew and a Polack, just died and were being judged
as to their worthiness of entering the Pearly Gates. St. Peter said that
they were all equally bad, so the ones that proved themselves in a test of
faith would get in. He told each of them he will lock them up in a room for
20 years. When he came back, whatever they'd done for him is what they get
judged by. So, he told the Italian, "I'm going to put you in this room with
one thing of your choice, what will that be?" The Italian guy tells him, "I
wanna me a woman". And so it is done. St. Peter then turned to the Jew and
asked him the same thing. The jewish guy wanted a telephone. And it was
done. Then St. Peter went to the Polack, who wanted a ciggarrette. And so
was done.

Twenty years passed, and St. Peter opens the Italian's room and there were
a dozen children running around and playing games and things. And he says,
"Looka, St. Pietro, I madea you a big family! Buona Sera!" St. Peter was
proud of this and smiled, and the pearly gates open for the Italian. Then
St. Peter went to the next door and there's the jewish guy with a load of
money all piled up. "Hey Pete, babe, I got ya all this cash, and this can
do some very good for the orphans down below. All the real estate and stock
marketing I've done, paid off. So do I get in or what, huh?" And St. Peter
said, "Well I guess I could fit you in, but I chose the Italian guy first.
You've done good, enter."  And the Pearly Gates opened. Then St. Peter
moved down to the third room and the Polack was standing there with the
cigarrette and asked him "Can I have a light?"

A leper walked into a bar and sat down. The bartender glanced over and
promptly tossed cookies all over himself and the floor. The leper looked
hurt and said, "Hey, I know I'm not exactly handsome, but I do have feelings
and you could be a little sensitive about them." The bartender, wiping his
mouth on his sleeve, looked up and proclaimed, "I'm sorry as hell man, but
it wasn't you. That guy sitting next to you keeps dipping his crackers in
your neck."

The owner of a travelling circus was down on his luck and close to bank-
ruptcy, when he decided that the only way to increase attendance was to find
a great act that couldn't be topped. Since his lion tamer had quit, he put an
ad in the local paper for a replacement, requesting that all applicants come
to the circus the next day to audition.

The following day, two individuals showed up, a regular-looking guy, and a
knockout woman with a body that wouldn't quit. "Lady's first," declared the
owner, as he handed a whip, gun and chair to the beauty. He opened the cage
door. As a lion entered the cage from the other side, the woman, threw the
gun and whip aside, stripped off all of her clothes, sat on the chair with
her legs spread and looked the lion straight in the eye. The lion, being
most impressed with the sight before him, buried his head between the woman's
thighs and 'went wild.' After 15 minutes, the lion backed away from her and,
totally exhausted, rolled on his side and passed out.

While watching this, the circus owner knew he had the money maker that he
needed and was rubbing his hands together, thinking of all of the money he
was going to make with his new act. Turning to the man beside him, he asked,
"Well, do you think you can top that?" To which the man replied, "You bet
your ass I can! Just get that fucking lion out of the cage ..."

Three friends were standing around bragging about how great their pets were.

and said, "Go, Rover." Rover proceeded to cross to an operating table and do
a serious operation in spactacular fashion, including all major surgery and
stitching the wound closed. Upon completion of the surgery, Rover crossed to
the doctor who gave him some cookies. "Not bad," said the engineer, who
turned to his dog and said, "Go, Spot!" Where upon Spot crossed over to a
drafting table and, in five minutes, proceeded to knock out complete con-
struction blue prints for a 150 story office complex. When he was finished,
Spot crossed to the engineer, who gave him some cookies. The doctor and the
engineer turned expectantly to the lawyer, who shrugged. The lawyer turned to
his dog and said, "Okay Fido, they're finished." Where upon Fido pissed on
the plans, screwed both Rover and Spot, and stole their cookies.

An elderly woman walked into the main branch of the Chase Manhatten Bank
holding a large paper bag in her hand. She told the young man at the window
that she wished to take the $3,000,000 she had in the bag and open an
account with the bank. She said that first, however, she wished to meet
the president of Chase Manhattan Bank due to the large amount of money
involved. The teller seemed to think that was a reasonable request and,
after opening the paper bag and seeing bundles of $1,000 bills which
amounted to right around three million, telephoned the bank president's
secretary to obtain an appointment for the woman. The woman was escorted
upstairs and ushered into the president's office. Introductions were made
and she stated that she would like to get to know the people she did busi-
ness with on a more personal level. The bank president then asked her how
she came into such a large sum of money. "Was it an inheritance?" he asked.
"No," she replied. "Was it from playing the stock market?" he inquired.
"No," she answered. He was quiet for a minute, trying to think of where
this elderly woman could have come into three million dollars. "I bet,"
she stated. "As in horses?" he asked. "No," she replied, "I bet people."
Seeing his confusion, she explained that she just bet on different things
with people. All of a sudden she said, "I'll bet you $25,000 that 10 o'clock
tomorrow morning your balls will be square." The bank president figured she
must be off her rocker and decided to take her up on the bet. He didn't know
how he could lose. For the rest of the day he was very careful - he didn't
even have the traditional nooner with his secretary. He decided to stay home
that evening and take no chances; there was $25,000 at stake. When he got up
in the morning and took his shower, he checked to make sure everything was
okay. There was no change in his crotchal appearance. He looked the same as
he always had. He went to work and waited for the old lady to come in at
10 o'clock, humming as he went. He know this would be a lucky day - how often
did he get handed $25,000 for doing nothing? At 10 o'clock sharp, the woman
was shown into his office. With her was a man. When the bank president asked
what the other man was doing in the office, she informed him that he was her
lawyer and she took him along when there was this much money involved.
"Well," she asked, "what about our bet?" "I don't know how to tell you this,"
he laughed, "but I'm the same as I've always been - only $25,000 richer."
The lady seemed to accept this, but requested that she be able to see for
herself. The president thought this was reasonable and dropped his trousers.
She instructed him to bend over and then grabbed a hold of him. Sure enough,
everything was fine. His balls were not square. The president then looked up
and saw her lawyer standing  across the room banging his head against the
wall. "What's wrong with him?" he inquired. "Oh, him," she answered, "I bet
him $100,000 that by 11 o'clock this  morning I'd have the president of Chase
Manhattan Bank by the balls."

penis has grown an additional four inches since your last exam." "Great!"
the man shouted, "What is the bad news?" "It's malignant," replied the
doctor.

"Send that cute giraffe at the end of the bar a drink on me". The bartender
replied, "Listen buddy, every eligible man in the bar has tried to hit on
that giraffe all night long. She just isn't interested. Save your money."
But the mouse insisted, "Look pal, I know what I'm doing - just send the
lady a drink." Not wanting to start a fight, the bartender did as he was
told and, to his amazement, he noticed the mouse make eye contact with the
giraffe. The mouse moved down the bar and at on a stool next to the giraffe.
They began to talk, and pretty soon they left the bar together. The next day,
in walked the mouse, his clothes are a mess, his tail broken - he looked

While driving through a small town in Old Mexico, an American tourist blew
out a tire. It was during the siesta, so when he arrived at the gas station
a sign hanging in the door announced that the station was "Closed, come back
soon!" The tourist looked behind the station and saw a Mexican sleeping in
the shade of his burro. The sleeping Mexican being the only sign of life in
the small town, the tourist walked over to him. "Pardon me!" said the tourist
in typically tactful tourist fashion. Without even lifting his hat the little
Mexican said, "It's siesta time senor." "What time is this siesta over?"
demanded the tourist. The Mexican said, "At two o'clock, senor." Starting to
turn red, the tourist stammered, "And would you know what time it is NOW?"
So the Mexican lifted his hat, looked at the Burro, puts his hand under it's
balls, lifted slightly, and said, "Itz 1:30 senor." "You tell the time of day
by holding that ass's balls in your hand?" the amazed tourist replied.
"No senor - the balls was in the way of the clock on the station's wall ..."

Mr. Bus Driver began his route in the usual way one morning, although the
turnout was quite unique, here is his story: His bus was named the 'Sesame
Street Bus' - possibly after the street he lived on or from another source
somewhere in his youth. His first passengers for the day were two passen-
gers named Patty and Patty; yes, they were twins, and they were quite heavy.
The next stop was Mr. Bus Driver's favorite as Ross got on and said hello.
Though Ross was slow, he was a nice enough fellow. A new fellow who the
driver hadn't met before was introduced at the third stop (for the driver
as Lester Chin. Lester had a slight foot problem and after he got on the
bus, he proceded to remove his shoes and pick at the corns on his feet -
which the bus driver ignored, possibly because he was pretty disgusted.
It was near the end of the route, and the passengers were getting ready
to disembark, when Mr. Bus Driver pulled up alongside a fellow busdriver.
"What have you got today?" the other bus driver asked. Mr. Bus Driver
answered, "Two obese Pattys, special Ross, and Lester Chin picking bunyons
on the Sesame Street bus ..."

The newfie went to the zoo to feed the monkies. He threw a monkey a peanut.
The monkey picked up the peanut, stuck it in his ass, pulled it out, and
ate it. The newfie thought this was rather unusual, so he threw the monkey
another peanut. The monkey again picked up the peanut, stuck it in ass,
pulled it out, and ate it. The newfie laughed as told the zookeeper, "Ooh-
boy, that's one stupid monkey!" The zookeeper watched the monkey's routine
and replied, "No, that's a very smart monkey. Last week someone threw him a
big peach and he ate it whole. He couldn't pass the pit, so now he measures
everything first!"

Once upon a time, a woman complained to her doctor that she and her husband
never had sex anymore. So the doctor gave her a bottle of pills and told her
to put them in his drink and she would be 'satisfied.' The woman, somewhat
disbelievingly, put one pill in his coffee that evening. That night they made
out ... The next morning, she put two in his coffee, and that night they
really got it on ... The next day, she said 'what the hell,' and put the
entire bottle in ... A few days later, the doctor called to check on her
progress. The woman's son answered the phone. When the doctor asked how she
was doing, the son replied, "Mom's dead; sis is pregnant; my asshole hurts,
and Dad is out naked on the front lawn yelling 'Here kitty, kitty.'"

Dirty Ernie jumped to his feet, stuck his hand in his pocket and said, "I've
got something in my hand which is long, stiff, and has a bright pink tip!"

A proper business man met a beautiful chorus girl, who agreed to spend the
night with him for a fee of $500. When he was ready to leave, he told her he
did not have the cash with him, but he would have his secretary mail her a
check calling it, "Rent for Apartment." On his way to the office he decided
that the whole thing was not worth the price he had agreed to pay, so he
decided to send her a check for $250.00 for rent of her apartment, along
with a note:

                   I was under the impression that:
                     1. It had never been occupied
                     2. There would be plenty of heat
                     3. It was a small apartment

                   Last night I found it had been occupied
                   and there was not any heat; also, it was
                   entirely too large.

Upon receipt of the note, the girl immediately returned the check for $250
with the following note:

                   Dear Sir:
                     1. I can not understand how you expected
                        such a beautiful apartment to remain
                        unoccupied.
                     2. As for the heat, there is plenty of it -
                        if only you knew how to turn it on.
                     3. As for the size of it, it was not my
                        fault you didn't have enough furniture
                        to fill my apartment.

A preacher stopped at the butcher shop one afternoon to get some meat for
the evening meal. He said to the butcher, "May I have a pound of ham,
please." The butcher said, "OK, Reverend, a pound of Dam Ham." The preacher
became upset and questioned the butcher as to why a church going man would
speak to a man of the cloth like that. The butcher said, "I'm sorry Reverend,
you misunderstood. That is the name of the product, 'Dam Ham.'" With that,
appologies were made and off the preacher went.

When he got home, the preacher said, "I'm home dear - and I brought the Dam
Ham." She looked at him like he had gone crazy, but he explained that was
the name of the ham.

At dinner that evening, the family gathered at the table and heads were
bowed for the blessing. Upon the word 'Amen,' all looked up and the preacher
said, "Well dear, how about passing me some of that Dam Ham." With that,
Junior, who had not eaten all day, said, "And how about passing some of them
fucking potatoes?"

A guy opened up a new bar, but he couldn't think of a name for it, so one
of his friends suggested that he name the bar after the first lady to walk
in. "Good idea," replied the proud owner. Later that day a young lady, wear-
ing a small, tight mini-skirt that revealed velvety, tanned legs, walked
in and applied for a job as a cocktail waitress. The owner said she had a
job if she would let him name the bar after her. And so it was that the bar
became known as 'Judith's Legs.' A few weeks later two bums were loitering
outside the bar. A cop came by and asked the bums what they were doing.
One of the bums relied, "I'm waiting for 'Judith's Legs' to open so I can
get a drink ..."

During Jesus' crucifixion, a mob of angry people gathered at the base of the
hill that his cross sat on top of. The guards kept all of them back, includ-

me!" John fought his way bravely through the angry mob and almost reached
the top of the hill when the guards caught him and hurled him back down. As
John lay on the earth, Jesus again called out to him, "John! Come to me!"
John bravely fought his way into the mob, up the hill and past the guards -
almost reaching the base of the cross. The guards again caught him and hurled
him back into the mob. "John! Come to me John! Come to me," Jesus cried. This
time nothing would stop him; John pushed his way through the crowd, fought
off the guards, and reached the cross that his Master was on. Then he
kneeled, "It is I Lord, John, what is it you wish?" Jesus looked at him
and smiled, "Look John, Look! I can see your house from up here!"

he pulled out another drawer. "Well," the guy said, "those are pretty hefty,
but what I had in mind was something truly spectacular!" The doctor grunted
and begrudgingly opened a third drawer.  "Now you're talking, Doc. That's
exactly what I had in mind, but tell me, you got any in white?"

and cost one million dollars. They discovered that the head of the penis is
there for the man's pleasure. After hearing this, the Polish government
spent twenty minutes and $1.49 to discover that men have a head on their
penii to keep their hands from sliding off.

pants in this family!" With that, she flipped him her panties and said, "Try
these on." He tried them on but found that he could only get them on as far

"I'm playing football," he said, "The score is 6-0." His wife thought
(Okay, you smart ass. I'll show you) and she let loose a fart of her own.
"I'm playing too," she said. "The score's 6-6 now." The man laughed and

instead. "Halftime," he said. "We change sides."

bells means you undress. Four bells means you jump into bed and do what
women do best." Things go according to plan, except the wife picked up the
bell while they were in the sack one night and rang it five times. "What
the hell does that mean," the fireman asked. The wife replied, "That means
reel out more hose, you aren't close enough to the fire."

                        THE BIRTH OF A CANDY BAR

One PAYDAY, MR. PEANUT wanted a BIT O'HONEY, so he took MARY JANE behind
the POWERHOUSE on the corner of CLARK and FIFTH AVE. He began to feel her
MOUNDS. It was pure ALMOND JOY. It made her TOOTSIE ROLL.  He let out a
SNICKER as his BUTTERFINGER went up her JUICYFRUIT and caused a MILKY WAY.
She screamed "OH HENRY!" as she squeezed his PETER PAUL and ZAGNUTS. MARY
JANE said, "You are even better than the THREE MUSKETEERS." Soon she was a
bit CHUNKY and nine months later had a BABY RUTH.

One fine day in the summer of 1980, a Polish architect gathered thousands
and thousands of Polish steelworkers, carpenters, etc. and said to them,
"We have to do something about the way the world looks at Poland! We should
build the biggest bridge in the world, bigger than any other, then they will
respect us, so go to it ... for Poland!" So the inspired laborers went off
and come back 10 years later. The foreman announced, "We have built the
biggest bridge in the world, bigger than any other!" The architect of the
idea asked, "Well where is it, across the Atlantic?"

"No, not quite that big."

"Across the Mediterranean?"

"No, not there either."

"Then where the hell is it!?"

"It is in the middle of the Sahara desert," said the foreman proudly.

"What?", said the archtitect in disbelief. "Quick, take it down before
someone sees it. Blow it up if you have to!"

So the foreman left. Soon he came back and said, "We can't."

"Why not?" is the replied the angry architect.

"Because," explained the foreman, "there are 500 Italians fishing off of
it!"

                HOW TO TELL IF YOU ARE TURNING REPUBLICAN

                              (By Dave Barry)

The Republicans have a high Beady-eyed, self-righteous, scary, borderline loon
quotient, as evidenced by Phyllis Schlafly, Pat Robertson, and the entire
state of Utah, etc.  It's very common for people reaching middle age to turn
into Republicans. It can happen overnight. You go to bed as your regular old
T-shirt-wearing self, and you wake up the next morning with Ralph Lauren
clothing and friends named "Muffy". Here are some other signs to watch for:

     -- You find yourself judging political candidates solely on the
        basis of whether or not they'd raise your taxes. "Well", you
        say, "He *was* convicted in those machete slaying, but at least
        he won't raise my taxes."

     -- You start clapping wrong to music. This is something I've noticed
        about Republicans at the conventions. The band will start playing
        something vaguely upbeat - a real GOB rocker such as "Bad, Bad
        Leroy Brown" - and the delegates will decide to get funky and
        clap along, and it immediately becomes clear that they all suffer
        from a tragic Rhythm Deficiency, possibly caused by years of
        dancing the Bunny Hop to bands with names like "Leon Wudge and
        His Sounds of Clinical Depression." To determine whether Repub-
        lican Rhythm Impairment is afflicting you, you should take the
        Ray Charles Clapping Test. All you do is hum the song "Hit the
        Road Jack" and clap along. A rhythmically normal person will
        clap as follows: "Hit the road, (clap, clap)." (By the way, if
        you don't even *know* the song "Hit the Road Jack," then not
        only are you a Republican, but you might even be Cabinet
        material.)

I'll tell you what's weird. Not only is our generation turning into Repub-
licans, but we also have a whole generation coming after us that's starting
*out* as Republicans. With the exception of a few dozen spittle-emitting
radicals I saw at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta, the younger
generations today are already so conservative they make William F. Buckley
Jr. look like Ho Chi Minh. What I'm wondering is, what will they be like
when they are our age? Will they, too, change their political philosophy?
Will millions of young urban professionals turn 40 and all of a sudden start
turning into left-wing anti-establishment hippies, smoking pot on the
racquetball court and putting Che Guevara posters up in the conference room
and pasting flower decals all over their cellular telephone? It will be an
exciting time to look forward to. I plan to be dead.

Once upon a time a sailor ran into his doctor's office and begged him for
help. He pulled down his pants and showed the doctor his dick, which was
sporting a ruby red ring around the tip. He asked the doctor if there was
any cure for this strange VD that had appeared. The doctor just smiled,
soaked a cloth in alcohol, and rubbed the end of the dick three times. The
sailor looked down and saw that the ring was gone. Ecstatic, he paid the
doctor and ran off to catch his ship. A few months later, another sailor
came to the doctor and said to him: "A few months back, my buddy came here
with a ring around his dick, and he said you just rubbed it three times and
he was cured. Well, I have a similar problem ..." The sailor pulled down
his pants and showed off his dick, which was sporting an emerald green ring
around the tip. Well, the doctor just reached into a pocket, took out a large
knife, and with one whack cut off the sailor's dick. "What did you do that
for!?" screamed the sailor in agony. "Your buddy had lipstick around his
dick," explained the doctor, "You had gangrene."

One night an elderly couple was sitting on the front porch in their rocking
chairs. All of a sudden, the old woman leaned over and knocked the crap out
of the old man. The old man, laying on the ground asked, "What was that for?"
The old woman answered, "That's for having such a small sex organ all these
years." So the old man got back on his rocker again. After a few minutes the
old man leaned over and knocked the crap out of the old lady. The old lady
said, "What the heck was that for?" The old man replied, "For knowing the
damn difference."

Last year a guy went to a doctor because he was losing weight. He found out
he had a tapeworm, and was instructed by the doctor to bring a muffin, a
twinkie and a cookie with him on his next visit. When he was being examined
the doctor shoved the muffin, the twinkie, and finally the cookie up the
guy's ass. The patient protested, but the doctor calmed him down, saying it
was part of the therapy. This treatment continued for several weeks and every
time the doctor shoved a muffin, a twinkie and a cookie up his ass. Finally,
after many visits, the Doctor instructed the patient to bring a muffin, a
twinkie and a mallet for the next visit. The day arrived and this time the
doctor shoved only the muffin and the twinkie up the patient's ass. After a
few minutes the tapeworm appeared out of his asshole and demanded, "Where's
my cookie!?"

WHAM!!!!!!!!!!!!

There once was a man who had a very well developed liking for beans (green
beans, wax beans, kidney beans, limas - it didn't matter which, he liked
them all). He would go out of his way to get a good bowl of beans. There
came a day, however, when he had to forsake his beloved beans for his only
other love - the girl he was to marry. He did without his beans for several
years. Then, one day, which happened to be his birthday, he was walking home
from work when he passed a small roadside cafe which was having a special
on ... baked beans! "Since it's my birthday," he thought, "I deserve a
special present. I'll have enough time to get rid of the after effects
before I get home, so I'll treat myself to a steaming bowl of those beans!"
So he went in and had bowl, after bowl, after bowl of them. He then pro-
ceeded to lay a noxious vapor trail all the way home. When he arrived at
home, his wife met him outside the door with a blindfold, saying, "I don't
want you to see your surprise." After blindfolding him, she led him into
the dining room, seated him at the table and left, saying, "I have to get
the rest of your surprise." While she was gone, he felt the urge to get
rid of some of the tremendous pressure that was building up, so he lifted
one leg to get some relief. He didn't get enough leverage, so he lifted
the other leg, and proceeded to rip a prolonged, and very wet, fart. Soon
he heard his wife returning, so he straightened his pants legs, waved the
air, and settled himself. When his wife returned, she removed his blind-
fold to reveal a melted birthday cake and his friends passed out around
the table.

my nose."

YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD!" she shrieked, even louder this time. Mortally
embarrassed, the man slunk off to a corner of the bar. A few minutes later,
the young woman approached him with an apology. "You'll have to excuse me,"
she said. "I'm writing a doctoral thesis on the response of human beings to
sudden shocking statements." The man looked at her curiously, then said in
his loudest voice, "YOU'LL DO ALL THAT, ALL NIGHT, FOR JUST TEN DOLLARS?"

On this farm there used to be a cat and a rooster, but the rooster and the
cat didn't get along very well. The cat was nosey about where the rooster
went everyday, but the rooster wouldn't tell him anything at all and this
made the cat mad. So one day the cat decided to follow the rooster to see
where it was he went everyday. He followed the rooster to a stream where
the rooster would jump across, but the cat was afraid of falling in. This
went on about a week and then the one day the rooster saw the cat follow
him and stop at the stream, too afraid to cross over. The rooster started
jumping back and fourth across the stream teasing the cat because he was
afraid to jump over. This made the cat very mad and he decided if the
rooster could do it then so could he. The cat got a running start and
jumped, but landed in the middle of the stream where he drowned. The
moral of this story is that for every happy cock there is a wet pussy.

There men died and went to hell. Satan met them at the gates and said, "All
three of you weren't bad enough to go straight to Hell, so you get another
chance. If you can tell me something I can't do you can go to Heaven." The
first man said, "Make a car made of solid gold that runs on gasoline."
Satan did and the man went into Hell. The second man said, "Make a house
of solid silver." Satan did and the guy went into Hell. The last man was
a biker and he was laughing. Satan said, "How can you laugh when you are
at the gates of hell?" The biker stopped laughing, farted, and said, "Catch
it."

One day Joe came hobbling in the club house with a 7 iron wrapped around his
neck. Of course everyone was curious as to what happened to poor ol' Joe.
Sam asked, "What happened to you?" In a raspy whisper, Joe told this tale
of woe:

     I was teeing off on the 5th hole and I shagged my ball out into
     this field of cows. I went over the fence and was looking for my
     ball when this lady on the 12th tee shagged her ball into this
     same field. So we're both looking for our balls when I happened
     to see this one cow acting a little different than the rest. I
     went over and raised its tail and damned if there wasn't a golf
     ball stuck in its asshole. So I hollered at the lady, "Hey lady,
     does this look like yours?"

                     A COWBOY'S VIEW OF REINCARNATION

                              (By Wally McRee)

"What's reincarnation?" a cowboy asked his friend. His old pal told him:

     It starts when your life comes to it's end: They comb your
     hair and wash your neck and clean your fingernails and put
     you in a padded box, away from life's travails. Then the box
     and you goes in a hole that's been dug into the ground.
     Reincarnation starts when you're planted beneath that mound.
     Them clods melt down, just like that box and you inside - and
     that's when you're beginning your transformation ride. And in
     awhile the grass will grow upon your rendered mound until some-
     day upon that spot a lonely flower is found. And then a "hoss"
     done eat it along with his other feed - makes bone and fat
     essential to the steed - but there's a part that the horse can't
     use and so it passes through and there it lies upon the ground.
     This thing that once was you, and if by chance I should pass by
     and see this on the ground, I'll stop awhile and I'll ponder at
     this object that I've found. And I'll think about reincarnation
     and life and death and such, and I'll come away concludin' "Why,
     you ain't changed all that much!"

A doctor was taking a group of interns on rounds at a hospital. All of a
sudden, another intern came racing down the corridor, shouting "Quick, doc-
tor, give me a pen!" The doctor reached into his pocket and handed the intern
something. The intern looked at the object and said, "Doctor, this isn't a
pen. It's a rectal thermometer." The doctor looked at the thermometer and
exclaimed, "Dammit, some asshole has my pen!"

One day a kid came home and yelled, "Ma, Ma, I had sex for the first time
today!" The mother was outraged and sent the kid upstairs to his room. When
the father got home, the mother explained the situation, whereupon the
father marched staright up the stairs to his son's room. "I Hear you had
sex, son." said the father in a stern voice. "Yeah ..." "Way to go! Now
you're a man! I'm proud of you son." The next day at work the father told
the guys at work about his 'improved' son. That night he came home from
work and again went to his son's room. "So, son, did you have sex again
today?" "No Dad; my asshole is still sore from yesterday ..."

There once was an career aggie who was well into his 12th year at A&M. His
father, an arch-supporting alumni, was growing tired of his son not having
graduated yet. He himself took only 10 years. So he pressured the dean to
simply graduate his son and be done with it. Not wanting to give preferen-
tial treatment to the rich alumni, but still wanting his substantial finan-
cial support, the dean decided to test the boy and, if he passed the exam,
then he would grant him his graduate degree. So the dean called the son
into his office and explained the matter, telling him he only had three
questions and that it was an overnight, open book, test (Not wanting to
leave anything up to chance). Then he listed the questions:

1. How many Days of the Week begin with a "T"?
2. How many Seconds are there in a Year?
3. How many "D's" are there in DIXIE?

The youth hurried home and began to work. The next day he returned to the
dean's office, obviously worn to a frazzle, having stayed up all night
working. The dean asked him, "Okay son, for the first question, how many
days of the week begin with a "T", what is your answer?" The son said,
"Well, 'course that was the first and easiest one ... There are two days,"
(The dean smiled) "Today and Tomorrow!" The dean began to sweat and wiped
his face. "Well I suppose there is a certain amount of truth to that answer,
so I'll accept it. Now, for the second question: How many seconds are there
in a year? The son replied, "You know that had me workin' a long time, till
I looked at my calendar fer help. Then it come to me: there are 12 seconds
in a year. The 2nd of January, 2nd of Feb ..." The Dean almost lost it, but
then regained composure. "Son," he said, "I believe we misphrased the
question, so I'm going to give you credit for it. Now, for the third and
final question, how many D's are there in "Dixie"? The lad just smiled,
and said, "That's the one what kept me up all night until I got it right!
There are 232 D's!" he said proudly. "What do you mean, 232?" sputtered the
dean. "How did you come up with that?" "Well, you gotta just count like
this: Dee Dee Dee, De De De De Dee Dee Deeee ..."

One bright and early afternoon a ventriloquist was walking through a field
when he encountered an indian grazing his cow, horse and sheep. The man
smiled at the indian and asked, "How are you doing today Mr. Indian?" The
Indian smiled and said, "Me fine." The man then turned to the cow and asked,
"And how are you doing today Mr. Cow?" The Indian got a puzzled look on his
face and said, "Cow no talk." The man threw his voice at the cow saying,
"Oh, I'm o.k., but sometimes this indian's hands are cold when he tries to
milk me." The indian's eyes grew wide. Then the man turned to the horse
and asked, "And how are you doing today Mr. Horse?" The indian once again
looked at the man and said, "Horse no talk." The man threw his voice again,
saying, "Oh, I'm o.k., but sometimes when this Indian is riding me he hits
me awful hard." The indian's eyes grew even wider. Finally, the man looked
to the sheep and asked, "And how are you doing today Mr. Sheep?" The indian
quickly shouted, "Sheep lie! Sheep lie!"

There were three couples who wanted to be members of a church: an elderly
couple, a middle-aged couple and a newlywed couple. The preacher said,
"To become members you have to abstain from sex for one whole month."
All three couples agreed and arranged to return in one month. After the
month had passed, the preacher asked each couple how well they had done.
The elderly couple reported they had succeded with little difficulty. The
middle-aged couple said it was challenging, but that they had also succeded.
Then the preacher asked the newlyweds how they had done. The husband said,
"Well, the first two weeks were o.k., the third week was really challenging,
but during the fourth week my wife bent over to get a can of vegtables and
I just lost all control." The preacher said, "Well, then, I'm sorry to say
that you can't become members of our church."  To which the husband replied,
"That's o.k., they won't let us back in the grocery store either."

Once upon a time, a man was walking along the beach when he saw a beautiful
girl who, sadly, had no legs. She was in her wheelchair bawling her eyes
out. "What's wrong?" he asked. "I've never been hugged before," she replied.
So he hugged her. The next day on his walk, he saw her again. Once more, she
was crying. "What's wrong now?" he asked. "I've never been kissed before."
she sobbed. So he proceeded to lay a lip-lock on her. The third day he was
walking by and AGAIN saw the poor girl crying. By now annoyed, he snapped,
"Now what?" "I've never been fucked before ..." she said hopefully. Where-
upon he proceeded to pick her up out of her wheelchair and throw her in the
water. "Now you're fucked!"

One day Adam was in the Garden of Eden when God came over to him and said,
"I made something for you. What I made for you will do anything you say,
fix your meals and give you indescribable pleasure. It will take care of
you always and it will never give you any trouble." Adam thought a moment
and said, "What does it cost me?" God said, "Just an arm and a leg." Adam
said "Sorry, but that's too steep for me. What can I get for a rib?"

Once upon a time there was a mathematician who found an equation for GOD. It
was, of course, a very complicated equation but, she figured, all she had to
do was find a computer system which (1) had a large enough memory to store
all the necessary variables, and (2) was fast enough to gather all the infor-
mation together. Once this was accomplished, all the mysteries of the Uni-
verse could be solved. So the government took every available micro-
processor, linker, loader, assembler and anything else they had available,
put them all together and asked the computer: "Is there a God?" Unfortu-
nately, however, the computer's response was that it would take, at the
very least, a century or two to solve the problem. This wasn't good enough
for the bureaucrats in Washington who, for the first time in their lives
wanted something other than the status quo. So they decided to follow that
up by taking every single computer in the entire nation and, linking them
all together into one giant, ever-so-much-bigger, super-computer, asked
once again, "Is there a God?" Well, this time the computer said that it
would take only ten years to solve the equation  Not as bad, but still not
quick enough to satisfy all the eager philosophers and scientists. "Some-
thing more must be done!" they shouted. By this time the whole world was
beginning to pay attention to the project and everone wanted to get
involved. After much debate, the United Nations decided to build the com-
puter and discover if there really was a God. So they took every computer
system in the world and linked them all together into one single amazing
super-duper-computer - the likes of which had never, EVER, been seen
before! Once again the scientists asked, "Is there a God?" The response?

"THERE IS NOW!"

they will turn out the lights and lock the door. If you tell the Army to
secure a building, they will occupy it and forbid entry to those without a
pass. If you tell the Marines to secure a building, they assault it with
heavy fire, capture the building, fortify it and call in an air strike.

Father John looked at the Sister Agnes and said, "Looks like this is it for

Father John. "Me too." said Sister Agnes. So they both undressed. When had
both disrobed, Sister Agnes looked down at the Father John's sceptre and
said, "What is that?" Father John told the good Sister that it was the Shaft
of Life. Said Sister Agnes: "Then, why don't you stick it in that camel so
we can get the hell out of here?"

write a paper on the difference between theory and fact. Can you help me?"
"Why sure son. Go and ask your mom if she would sleep with old Mr. Johnson
next door for half-a-million dollars." The son was puzzled at this, but went
and asked mom anyway. He walked back in the room a short time later and said
"Yeah, mom would do that." "Go and ask your sister the same question." said
the father. Junior ran up the stairs, asked Sis, and came thundering down
the stairs. "She said she would also." "Okay son, here's the difference: In
theory, we're millionaires. But, in fact, we're living with a couple of
sluts."

The school bus approached the curb and slowed but, upon noticing a gibbering
kid stumbling around, gooking all over the place, the driver stepped on the
pedal and left the kid in a cloud of dust. Next day, the bus approached the
same curb, but upon noticing the gibbering, drooling kid with his arms
flopping around, the bus smoked by the kid again. The third day, the bus
again approached the curb.  Once again, the kid on the curb was frantically
stumbling around, drooling and gibbering. The bus burned rubber, hopped the
curb, and ran right over the stumbling kid. Later, the police arrived. The
officer asked the bus driver, "I understand that you failed to pickup the
poor kid all week long and, as if that weren't enough, you ran him over!.
What do you have to say for yourself?" To which the driver replied, "He
wuth makking fthun uff me!"

Dirty Ernie got a duck for his birthday. He took it for walks every day
and enjoyed having a pet. One day, Sleezy Suzy saw him walking the duck,
and said, "Hey, I like your duck. Will you give it to me if we go into the
bushes and fool around?" Dirty Ernie agreed, and off they went. When they
finished, Dirty Ernie said, "Hey, if you'll give me my duck back, we can
do that again." So they fooled around in the bushes some more. Unfortu-
nately, about this time a big truck came barreling down the street. The
truck driver saw the duck in the road, and slammed on his brakes - but no
luck - he ran right over it. The driver told Dirty Ernie, "Hey kid, I'm
sorry about your duck. Here's a dollar to pay for it." Later, when Dirty
Ernie finally got home, his dad asked him how his day was. Dirty Ernie
said, "Not bad, Dad. I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and a
buck for a fucked-up duck."

                fair and equal restroom time for all employees. Under
                this policy, a "Restroom Trip Bank" will be established
                for each employee. The first day of each month, employees
                will be given twenty (20) Restroom Trip Credits. Restroom
                Trip Credits may be accumulated from month to month.

Exceptions:     Pregnant employees (male or female) will be given forty
                (40) Restroom Trip Credits per month.

Definitions:    None.

Procedure:      Currently the entrances to all restrooms are being equipped
                with personnel identification stations and computer-linked
                voice print recognition devices. During the next two (2)
                weeks, each employee must provide two (2) copies of voice
                prints (one normal, one under stress) to Personnel Services.
                The Voice Print Recognition Stations will be operational,
                but not restrictive for the month of September; employees
                should acquaint themselves with the stations during that
                period. If an employee's Restroom Trip Bank balance
                reaches zero (0), the doors to all restrooms will remain
                locked for that employee's voice until the first of next
                month when the employee receives his/her next 20/40
                credits. In addition, all restroom stalls are being
                equipped with timed paper-roll retractors. If the stall
                is occupied for more than three minutes, an alarm will
                sound. Thirty seconds after the alarm sounds, the roll
                of paper in the stall will retract, the toilet will flush,
                and the stall door will open.

Liability:      It is the responsibility of all management personnel to
                ensure understanding and compliance with this policy.

There once was a business executive who decided he needed a little rest from
the daily routine, so he decided to take his pretty, young secretary to a
hotel for some whoopee. He rented a very nice, quiet room and they spent
the day drinking, going to bed, having lunch, drinking some more, back to
bed again, etc. Finally 5 o'clock came and they had to go their separate
ways. On the way home, he was thinking about what excuse he could tell his
wife if she was in the mood for having a 'party' tonight. He drove up the
driveway of his home and sure enough, there was his wife at the door, all
arrayed in a pretty gown and negligee, with pipe, slippers and cool drinks.
She led him into the house, with all the sweetness she possessed, to his
favorite armchair. He thought, "God I hope that this doesn't build up to
something." They sat back and relaxed, sipping their drinks and talking.
Suddenly, she said that she had forgotten something in the bedroom, got
up and said she would be right back. He thought, "Oh Lord, here it comes."
As soon as she had left the room he jumped up, unzipped his trousers, pulled
out 'Jasper' and started to bend it and whip it around trying to get some
life into it, but nothing happened - it did not help a bit. He heard her
returning so he stuffed 'Jasper' back into his trousers, zipped them up,
sat down and sighed. They continued their conversation, then she asked him
if he would care for another drink, and he replied that he would, so off
she went to the kitchen to fix it. He jumped up immediately, opening his
pants again, out with 'Jasper', up and down, around and around, back and
forth - all this with much more vigor than before - but to no avail. He
decided he would just have to tell her that he was too tired for the fun
and games tonight. She returned with their drinks, sat down and said,
"Dear, I've a most wonderful surprise for you, and I know that you will
be perfectly delighted." He thought, "Sure I will." Then aloud, "Well,
what is it?" She answered sweetly, and with a sly smile, "Guess what,
we're on Totally Hidden Video!"

Once upon a time, a newlywed couple were on their honeymoon in the Bahamas.
One day, while sun-bathing, the husband got a bad case of sunburn on his
dick. In terrible pain, he went back to their room to seek some relief. He
opened up the frig and found a bottle of milk. He poured a glass and soaked
his irritated cock within. As he was standing there, his wife walked in,
looked at him, and said, "So that's how it's done! I've always wondered
how you guys filled that thing up."

                    NEW ELEMENT DISCOVERED AT BELL LABS

(Boston) - The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered at
Bell Labs. The element, tentatively named ADMINISTRATIUM, has no protons or
electrons and thus has an atomic number of 0.  However, it does have one
neutron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice-neutrons, and 111 assistant-vice-
neutrons. This gives it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held
together, in a nucleus, by a force that involves the continuous exchange of
meson-like particles called morons.

Since it has no electrons, Administratium is inert. However, it can be
detected chemically as it impedes every reaction it comes in contact with.
According to Bell Lab scientists, a minute amount of Administratium caused
one reaction to take over four days to complete, when it would normally occur
in less than one second.

Administratium has a normal half-life of approximately three years - at which
time it does not actually decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in
which assistant neutrons, vice-neutrons, and assistant-vice-neutrons exchange
places. Some studies have shown that the atomic weight actually increases
after each reorganization.

Research at other laboratories indicate that Administratium occurs naturally
in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points such as govern-
ment agencies, large corporations, universities, and can be found in the
newest best maintained buildings.

Scientist point out that Administratium is know to be toxic at any level of
concentration and can easily destroy any productive reactions where it is
allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how Administra-
tium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date
are not promising.

An old man went into a bar in Wyoming. After having a few drinks he started

staring at him. The old man replied, "I just finished doing twenty-five
years in prison for screwing a buffalo. I just thought you might be my son."

     Last year on '20/20' Barbara Walters did a documentary on the customs of
American Indians. After a tour of the reservation, she inquired as to how the
number feathers in the indians' headdress was determined. She asked a brave
who had only one feather in his headdress. His reply was "Me have only one
squaw, me have only one feather." She asked another brave, thinking the
first fellow was only joking. This brave had four feathers in his headdress.
He replied, "Ugh! Me have four feathers because me sleep with four squaws."
Still not convinced the number of feathers indicated the number of squaws
involved, she decided to interview the chief.

     The Chief had a full headdress of feathers which, needless to say,
amused Ms. Walters. She asked the Chief, "Why do yuw haff tho many feathuh
in yuw headwess?" The Chief proudly pounded his chest and said, "Me Chief,
me fuckem all - big, small, fat, tall - me fuckem all." Horrified, Ms.
Walters stated, "Yuw thould be hung!" The Chief replied, "You damned right,
me hung - big like buffalo, long like snake ..." Ms. Walters spluttered,
"Yuw dwon't haff to be tho damned hothtile!" The Chief replied, "Hoss-
style, dog-style, wolf-style, any style, me fuckem all!" Tears in her
eyes, Ms. Walters cried, "Ow, dweer!" The Chief said, "No deer - me no
fuckem deer - asshole too high and fuckers run too fast. No fuckem deer!"

An office manager learned that, due to increased operating costs and slumping
sales, he would have to let one of his employees go. After much thought he
narrowed his choices down to two employees: Liz and Jack. Both were equal in
seniority and both were good workers, so the manager decided that he would
watch the two at work the next day and the first one to leave their desk was
the one who would be let go. When they arrived in the morning, both Liz and
Jack got right to work, and the manager began to wonder if his plan would
work. About mid-morning, however, Liz got up from her desk and asked Jack
for some aspirin. The manager had his victim. He caught up with Liz at the
water fountain: "I'm afraid I have a dilemma here," he said. "I'm going to
have to lay you or Jack off." "Well then, jack off," Liz snapped. "I've got
a headache!"

his son into the head and he said, "Kid, this is the way you do it by the
numbers: ONE! You unzip your fly. TWO!  You pull out your crank. THREE! You
piss! FOUR! You put it back in. FIVE! You zip up your pants. Got it?" The
little kid, being the son of a Marine, immediately responded with a thunder-
ing, "Aye, aye!" A day or so went by, and the Gunny spied his son going into
the head, so he snuck up to the door and listened: "One! Two! Three! Four!
Two! Four! Two! Four! ..."

Two men were hunting in the hills of Kentucky. Bo turned to Jim-Bob, after
taking a sip from his sixth beer of the hour, and said that he needed to step
into the bushes for a minute. So Bo walked out of sight and pulled out his
dick. Suddenly, a rattle snake slithered into sight! It coiled in defense,
as Bo froze - with dick still in hand. The snake, far from intimidated by
this small cylindrical object, struck and injected his poison into Bo's
staff. Bo cried and screamed until his Jim-Bob came to his rescue. After
rearranging the snake with a load of double-00, Jim-Bob calmed
Bo down and told him that he was going for help. So Jim-Bob wandered down
the holler to a small town. Finding a hand-cranked phone, he called the
nearest doctor and was told to cut two small incisions near the bite, and
suck the poison from the wound. Jim-Bob ran back up the holler to Bo - who
was by then quite distraught and nearly unconscious. Said Jim-Bob to Bo:
"The doc said ya'll gonna die."

When the Lord made Man, all the parts of the body argued over who would be
Boss. The Brain explained that since he controlled all the parts of the body,
he should be Boss. The Legs argued that since they took the Man wherever he
wanted to go, he should be Boss. The Stomach countered with the explanation
that since he digested all of the food, he should be Boss. The Eyes said that
without them, Man would be helpless, so they should be Boss. Then the Asshole
applied for the job. The other parts of the body laughed so hard that the
Asshole became mad and closed up. After a few days the Brain went foggy, the
Legs got wobbly, the Stomach got ill, and the Eyes got crossed and were
unable to see. So they all conceded and made the Asshole Boss.

This proves that you don't have to be a Brain to be Boss - just an Asshole.

"And what about this?" asked the psychologist, drawing a square. "Sex," was
the man's answer. "Well," the psychologist said to him, "you certainly seem
to be obsessed with sex." "What do you mean I'M obsessed with sex?" the man
exclaimed, "You're the one drawing all the dirty pictures!"

Two rich texans, J.D. the rancher, and Bo the oilman, were inseparable
friends. One evening, they made a vow. Whichever one of them died first
would try to contact the other from the spirit world. Not long after that,
J.D. died. Bo was despondent, but he decided to start attending seances in
the hopes of talking to his lifelong friend. For months, he had no luck.
Then, it happened! He was at a seance when he heard his name called, "Bo,
Bo, are yew there Bo?" "J.D.," he replied excitedly, "J.D., is that yew?"
"Yes, Bo," the far-off voice said, "It's me." "J.D., where are yew?" Bo
asked, "What are yew doing?" "Wayull," the disembodied drawled, "I get up,
have something to eat, screw all morning long. Then it's lunch time, so I
have another bite, then I screw most of the afternoon, take a nap, and it's
time to eat again. I screw long into the night, and then I fall into a
peaceful sleep." "J.D.!" Bo cried, "Ya'll must be in heaven!" "Heaven?"
the voice sighed, "I'm a bull in Oklahoma ..."

A friend of mine drives to work on a long stretch of country road. One
morning, as she was driving to work, she hit a bunny rabbit crossing the
road. She immediately stopped to render aid to the bunny. The bunny was not
dead, only mildly stunned. Being the not so bright person that she is, she
decided that she might be able to spray perfume on the rabbit to stun him
back into shape. She rummaged through her purse to get the perfume and
sprayed it on the rabbit. Immediately the bunny jumped up on its hind legs
and began to wave its front paw. Satisfied that the bunny was okay, she
drove on to work. That afternoon, on the way home, she noticed the rabbit
was still waving. She shrugged and continued home. The next morning, the
rabbit was still there, waving. The experience was repeated the next
morning and evening. By that time she was quite puzzled and decided that
she should look in her purse to see exactly what it was that she had
sprayed on the rabbit. She took the bottle out of her purse and on the
label it read ...

Once upon a time, a tomb was found in Egypt. First a team of British arche-

one."  Next an American team went in for two weeks and they reported much
the same; they too could not determine which pharoh it was. Finally a
Soviet team went in. After 20 minutes they came out and announced, "This
is the tomb of Ramses XXI!" The others were astonished and asked the
Soviets, "How could you tell which pharoh it was?" The Soviets answered,

HOW TO KILL A SOUTH DAKOTA EEL

     Little Johnny and the other boys his age were hearing quite a bit
about dating from the older boys, and wondering what it was all about and
how it was done. One day, Johnny decided to take these questions to his
mother who became quite flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny,
she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older
sister and her boyfriend. The next morning Johnny explained *EVERYTHING* to
his mother:

     "Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for a while, then he turned off
most of the lights and they started to hug and kiss. I figured sis must
have been getting sick, because she started looking funny. Her boyfriend
must have thought so too, because he put his hand up her shirt to find her
heart, just like a doctor would - except he is not as smart as a doctor,
because he had trouble finding her heart.

     "I guessed that her boyfriend must have been getting sick too, because
pretty soon they were both panting and out of breath. His other hand must
have been getting cold because he put it up her skirt. About this time, she
got worse; she began to moan, squirm around and slide down towards the end
of the couch. I knew she had a fever because she said she was feeling hot.

     "Then I found out what was making them so sick - a big eel had gotten
into her boyfriend's pants. It jumped out of his pants and stood there, about
10 inches long. Anyway, he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting
away. When sis saw it she got scared, and her mouth fell open to call God
and stuff like that. She said it was the biggest she had ever seen. I
thought I should tell them about the ones down at the lake ...

     "All of a sudden, sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting it's
head off. But it must have bit her back back because, after a few minutes,
she started making noises. So, she grabbed it tight with both hands while
her boyfriend put a muzzle on it to keep it from biting her again. Sis laid
back and spread her legs so that she could put a scissor-lock on it, and
he helped by laying on top of the eel.

     "The eel put up one hell of a fight. Sis started to moan and scream.
I guess that they wanted to kill the eel by squashing it between them. After
a while both quit moving and gave out a great sigh. Her boyfriend got up and
sure enough, they killed it. I knew it was dead because it just hung limp
there and some of it's insides were hanging out.

     "Sis and her boyfriend were tired from the battle, but they went at it
again. They started to kiss and hug again. I guess that eels are like cats,
with nine lives or something, because the eel got up and started to fight
again. This time sis tried to kill it by sitting on it. They finally killed
it - I knew it was dead this time because I saw sis's boyfriend peel it's
skin off and flushed it down the toilet."

     Little Johnny's mother fainted.

Guy walks into a bar and sets an alligator on the bar. He bets the bar-
tender a free drink that he could open the alligator's mouth, stick his
dick in and count to ten very slowly. The bartender said, "Yeah, I'll take
that bet." So, the guy unzipped his pants, pulled out his dick, layed it in
the gator's mouth and counted to ten. The bartender was astounded, "I can't
believe that! Hell, if there is anyone else in the bar who will do that,
I'll buy them a drink too." Whereupon a little guy in the back said, "I'll
do it, but I don't know if I can keep my mouth open that long."

After a few moments of obvious sniffing, the old lady said, "Hey lady,
you smell good! What's that smell?" The rich lady haughtily answered,
"I'll have you know that's 'Joy' - $95 an ounce." A few moments passed
and the italian lady let out a long, gurgling, smelly fart. The rich
woman recoiled in horror and gasped, "What's that smell!?" The Italian
lady answered, "I'll have you know that's broccoli - 79 cents a bunch."

WORKMAN'S COMPENSATION CLAIM

Dear sir:

I am writing in response to your request for additional information. In
block #3 of the accident reporting form, I put "LOST PRESENCE OF MIND" as
the cause of the accident. You said in your letter that I should explain
more fully, and I trust that the following details will be sufficient.

I am a brick layer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working
alone on the roof of a six-story building. After completing my work, I
discovered that I had about 500 pounds of unused bricks. Rather than
carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by
using a pully, which was fortunately attached to the side of the building
at the sixth floor.

Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel
out, and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went back to the ground and
untied the rope (holding it tightly to insure a slow descent of the 500
pounds of bricks). You will note in block #11 of the accident reporting
form that I weigh 135 pounds.

Due to my surprise at being jerfed off the ground so suddenly, I "LOST MY
PRESENCE OF MIND" and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I
proceeded at a rather rapid rate up the side of the building.

In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel comong down. This
explains my fractured skull and broken collarbone. Slowed only slightly,
I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right
hand were two knuckles deep into the pully.

Fortunately, by this time I had regained my "PRESENCE OF MIND" and was able
to hold tightly to the rope inspite of the pain. At approximately the same
time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out
of the barrel. Devoid of the weight of the bricks, the barrel now weighed
approximately 50 pounds.

I refer you again to my weight in block #11. As you might imagine, I began
a rapid descent down the side of the building. In the vicinity of the third
floor, I met the barrel coming up. This accounts for the two fractured
ankles and the laceration of my legs and lower body.

This encounter with the barrel slowed me enough to lessen my injuries when
I fell into the pile of bricks and, fortunately, only three vertebrae were
cracked.

I am sorry to report, however, that as I lay there on the bricks - in pain,
unable to stand, and watching the empty barrel six stories above - I again
lost "PRESENCE OF MIND" and let go of the rope.

Having just received a great promotion, John was excited about his new
position, new status and new office. He was checking through the desk
vacated by his predecessor when he came upon a letter, attached to three
envelopes, made out to him. The letter told him that if he got into trouble
he should open the first envelope. "Make sure you open them in order and
only if there is a real emergency," warned the letter. John laughed but
filed the envelopes away. Sure enough, within a month he felt the heat and
decided to give envelope number one a chance. He opened it and it said,
"Blame your predecessor!" So John went to his boss and told him how the bum
he had replaced had messed things up and that it would take him time to get
things back on track. And, with hard work, he did get the problems resolved.
Everything went fine for several more months before, once again, all hell
broke loose. In desperation, John opened the second letter. It advised him
to "Reorganize!" So John went to his boss and told him the solution would
mean a drastic reorganization. After this was done relative calm prevailed.
But the day inevitably came when another disaster struck. With trembling
hands, John opened the third, and final, envelope. The advice? "Make up
three more envelopes!"

An American, traveling on a train in Europe, met a Cuban tobacco grower,
a Russian vodka distiller and a lawyer. While they were talking business,
the Cuban took out four cigars and passed them around. After lighting his
own cigar, the Cuban took one drag and then threw it out the window,
explaining that cigars were of no consequence in his country since there
was such an abundance of them. After dinner, the Russian passed out bottles
of vodka. After taking just one swig, he threw the bottle out the window,
explaining that vodka was of no consequence since, in Russia, it was so
plentiful. The American businessman sat in quiet contemplation for several
minutes then arose and threw the lawyer out the window.

Once upon a time, an elephant was walking through the jungle. Unfortunately,
he walked right into a pool of quicksand. He panicked, and started thrashing
all around and yelling for help. Well, as great luck would have it, a monkey
was nearby. The monkey heard all the commotion, so he came over. "Elephant!"
said the monkey, "Don't thrash about so; you'll float if you just stay still.
I'll go get help to get you out." The elephant thought, "Now what is a little
monkey going to do for me?" But he laid still and, sure enough, he stopped
sinking into the quicksand. After awhile, the monkey came back in a BMW. He
took a vine off a tree, tied it to the BMW's bumper, and gave the end to the
elephant. With that, he pulled the elephant out of the quicksand and saved
his life!

Some time later, the monkey was swinging through the tree when his grip on
the vine slipped, and he fell right into some quicksand. He too panicked,
and started yelling and thrashing. Just as you'd know it, the elephant was
walking nearby, and heard the commotion. "Monkey, monkey!" cried the ele-
phant, "Don't flail around. Lie still, and I'll find a way to save you."
The monkey laid still and stopped sinking into the quicksand. The elephant
noted that the quicksand pool wasn't very wide. "Monkey, the quicksand
isn't very wide. I'll just straddle it. You reach up and grab ahold of me,
and I'll pull you out!" The monkey did as he was told, and his life was
saved.

The moral of the story is this: If your dick's big enough, you don't
need a BMW!

Bob lost his dick in a horrible traffic accident. Fully recovered
except for the use of "Mr. Happy," late one night he was watching TV.
During the commercial break an ad came on for "Doctor Smith's Miracle
Penis Replacement Clinic." The next day, Bob rushed to the clinic.
"Doctor," he begged, "I need to get a new dick." The doctor informed
Bob that the demand for newer, bigger and better dicks was so great that
all he had left were baby elephant trunks. But Bob was desperate, he didn't
hesitate to undergo the experimental surgery. Six months later, fully
healed and rehabilitated, Bob finally had the confidence to ask a lady
out to dinner. As they were eating dinner, this thing came out from under
the table, grabbed a biscuit, and darted back underneath the table. The
girl saw this and thought to herself, "If that happens again, I'm going
to have to say something." A few minutes later the thing came out from
under the table and grabbed another biscuit, so the lady said, "Bob, I
don't know what that is, but if it keeps taking my food, I'm calling a
cab!" Bob replied, "You're mad? Hell, it keeps stuffing the biscuits up
my ass!"

pill." "You don't understand," said the old man. "Dampness irritates my

THE DEFINITION OF EGO

An female elephant was having an awful time in the jungle because a horsefly
kept biting her near her tail and there was nothing she could do about it.
She kept swinging her trunk, but the fly was far out of reach. A monkey
observed this and suddenly swung down and slapped the horsefly flat. "Oh,
thank you! That was such a relief," said the elephant. "My pleasure,
ma'am," said the monkey. "Listen, Mr. Monkey, if there's anything I can
ever do for you, don't hesitate to ask." The monkey hesitated. "Well,
ma'am ..." he said. "What is it? You needn't be shy with me." "Well, the
truth is that all my life I wondered how it would feel to fuck an elephant."
"Go right ahead," said the elephant. "Be my guest!" So the monkey swung
around behind the elephant and began to fuck away. Up above them, a baboon
was peeping from a cocnut tree and began to get very excited; he started
to beat off. In his excitement the baboon shook a coconut loose. The coco-
nut fell from the tree, hitting the elephant smack on the head. "RE-eeee-
OOOHH!" the elephant trumpeted in pain. At which point, the monkey looked
over from behind the elephant and asked, "Am I hurting you, dear?"

The tent revival was in its fifth long night, and religious fervor was at a
peak when the normally taciturn Farmer John jumped up and ran down the aisle,
sobbing and with tears streaming down his face. The preacher met him with
outstretched hand and John bawled, "Preacher, I been a sinner!" "Tell it all,
John!" hollered the preacher, to the congregation's delight. "I been doin'
terrible things, Preacher," said John, and the congregation AMENed loudly.
"Drinkin' and everything ... I even cheated on my taxes!" "Tell it all,
John!" the preacher bellowed even louder, gripping the penitent John about
the shoulders. With the congregation providing loud vocal support, John
continued to recite his sins. "I been having ... you know, sex fantasies,"
he said, and the congregation swooned with a loud AMEN, and the preacher
hoarsely repeated his demand. Emboldened, John went on, "... and I been
visitin' the cathouse over in Hog Holler..." And with each revelation, the
murmuring excitement of the crowd got louder, and the preacher's exhorta-
tions grew more insistent that John `tell it all!' Caught up in the frenzy,
and the approval of his audience, John hollered, "... and I been screwin' my
mule!" There was instant and absolute silence in the tent. No one even
coughed, as John blinked and looked about in bewilderment. The preacher
leaned close to the confessor's ear and whispered, "Damn if I'da tol' that,
John ..."

A young boy came home from school one day and told his mother that he began

"There's gonna be no sex education as long as you live in this house.
Get upstairs and stay there until your father comes home!" So, the boy
went up to his room. Later, the old man came home and asked, "Where's the
boy?" His wife replied, "I'm punishing him up in his room. He says he
started taking a class in sex education class in school today." Enraged,
the father stormed up the stairs and burst into the boy's room where the
boy was lying on the bed masturbating. The father said, "Listen you, when
you're finished with your homework I want to talk to you!"

One day when Ernie was about six, before he learned about being dirty, he
was pestering his mom while she tried to do the housework. She said, "Why
don't you go across the street and watch them building the new apartments?
Maybe you will learn something ..." So Ernie left. When he came back two
hours later, his mother asked him what he had learned. Ernie replied, "Well,
first you put the goddamn door up. Then the sonofabitch doesn't fit, so you
have to take the cocksucker down. Then you have to shave a cunt hair off
each side and put the motherfucker back up!" Ernie's mother was shocked.
"Young man, you march yourself upstairs right this minute! Just wait until
your father gets home!" When Ernie Sr. got home, little Ernie's mother
called him downstairs and demanded that he tell his father what he had
'learned' that day. When little Ernie had finished his story, his father,
steam coming from his collar, said, "Ernie go outside and get me a switch."
So Ernie replied, "Get fucked! Thats the electrician's job!"

After enjoying a rich and sumptuous meal, and during the after dinner chit-

nobody had noticed the stagnant oder of romano cheese in the air. Unfortu-

Queen!" The president said, "I'm sorry your majesty, I didn't know it was

During the last recession a banker was going to committ suicide by jumping
off a bridge. As he leaned on the guardrail, he heard a far away voice
saying, "Do-o-o-on't ju-u-u-ump!" He looked around, but saw no one, so he
climbed up on the edge of the bridge and prepared to dive. Again he heard
the voice "Do-o-o-on't ju-u-u-ump!" This time he looked down and saw,
hidden in the shadow of the underpass, an incredibly old, and scaggly
woman. "Why not?" he yelled. "I'm in ruin: My company's bankrupt, my wife
has left me, my daughter's a groupie ..." he rambled on for some thirty
minutes. "Sonny, you shouldn't be thinking about suicide," she yelled
back. "Whatever your problem, I can solve it for you. You see, I'm a witch.
All you have to do is eat me and I'll solve all your problems!" The thought
of eating the old hag was revolting, but the banker figured he had nothing
to lose, so he climbed down off the bridge and made his way down the offramp
and ran quickly to the witch. He threw her down, tore off her rags, and
proceeded to give her a thorough tongue lashing. After a few moments of
this, the old hag began to shake and quiver. The banker noticed that she was
convulsed with laughter. He said, "What are you laughing at?" She answered,
"Sonny, aren't you a bit old to be believing in witches?"

A few drinks later, a stranger approached the Lone Ranger: "Does that big,

"Wehl," drawled the cowboy, "yuh left the injun runnin'."

There once was a bird who hated saying 'goodbye' so much, he waited until
the last minute to fly south for the winter. When he finally did leave, it
was so cold that his wings iced up and he fell to the ground on a nearby
farm. He was cold and very depressed and thought he was going to die then
and there. After awhile, a cow wandered by and shit on the bird. The bird
he was becomming warm, and could move around, so he began to sing. A nearby
cat heard the singing, and dug the bird from inside the pile of shit, and
ate him. There are exactly three morals to this story:

(1) Not everybody who shits on you is your enemy.
(2) Not everybody who takes shit off you is your friend.
(3) When you are in something warm and wonderful,
    keep your big mouth SHUT !!!

A scientist, after years of failed attempts, finally made a clone of him-
self. The clone was exactly like him; it liked the same foods, read the
same books, liked the same T.V. shows, etc. The one difference was that the
clone was terribly obscene. Every other word it uttered was an obscenity.
The scientist quickly grew tired of this, because it created embarrassing
situations everywhere they went. So, the scientist took the clone up to the
top of a cliff and pushed it off. Unfortunately, though, a policeman saw him
do this, and the policeman rushed up to him and said, "You're under arrest
for murder!" "But it wasn't a person I just pushed off the cliff. It was
just a clone," replied the scientist. "Well," the policeman said, "you're
still under arrest for making an obscene clone fall."

The telephone company put out a tender for the installation of telephone
poles. Three groups applied. A group of newfies (canadian polacks), a group
of jews, and a group of italians. Since there are three groups, the tele-
phone company decided to run a contest between them to see which one could
install the most telephone poles in an eight hour day. All three groups went
out and, in the evening, came back to report. "How many telephone poles did
you install?" the telephone executive asked the jews. "Oh, we installed 27
today," they said. "Very good," the executive said. "How many telephone
poles did you install?" the executive asked the italians. "Oh, we installed
24 today," they said. "Good, but not as good as the jews," said the execu-
tive. "How many telephone poles did you install?" the executive asked the
newfies. "Oh, we installed five today," a newfie said proudly. "I don't
understand this," the executive said, "The jews installed 27, and the
italians 24. How is it that you only installed five?!" "Well sir," the
newfie continued, "look at how much of the telephone poles they left above
the ground ..."

said, "Grandpa Sven always said that if you are lost, you should fire three
shots in the air. It's a distress signal, and someone will come to rescue."
So the second yupper fired three shots. They waited for awhile, and when no
one came the first yupper told his friend, "Fire three more shots." Again
no one came. Again, the first yupper told his friend, "Fire three more
shots." The second yupper replied, "I can't. I ain't got no more arrows."

you, sir?" the stewardess asked the miniser. "You should ask me, a man of
God, that my lips should touch alcohol? Why, I'd sooner commit adultry!"
The minister said indignantly. The rabbi waved at stewardess, "Hold the
martini! I didn't know we had a choice ..."

A Pole, a Jew, and a Mexican were in Kuwait, and all three were killed.
They all went to hell, where the Devil told them "I'm havin a REAL busy
day here guys, and frankly I don't have time to take care of you properly.
Tell ya' what, give me $5 each and I'll send you right back where you came
from." The Pole promptly paid the $5 and found himself back in the war zone,
where he ran to report to his company commander. The CO was curious, of
course, as to where the other two guys were. To which the Pole replied,
"Well, when I left, Goldstein was trying to talk him down, and Lopez was
looking for a co-signer ..."

A Brit and a Scot where standing on a corner talking when an Irishman walked
up. "You know what," said O'Brien, "I just went into that pub over there,
ordered a pint, and played some darts. When I walked out of the pub the
barkeep told me to pay up. So I told him I paid when I got my pint. He
didn't do anything to me, so I got a free drink!" Smyth-Jones, the Brit,
liked the idea so much he went into the pub and did the same thing the
O'Brien did. An hour later Smyth-Jones came out and told the Irishman, and
MacGregor, that the barkeep didn't give him any trouble either. So MacGregor
decided to try too. He walked into the bar and ordered a pint. As MacGregor
talked to the barkeep, the barkeep mentioned the two blokes who walked out
without paying. MacGregor asked the barkeep why he did nothing. The barkeep
said, "I'm not looking for trouble." MacGregor replied, "Well it's getting
late - if you'll give me my change, I'll be heading home ..."

Three bums - Dusty, Jake and Loner - were walking down some railroad tracks
when Jake stops and asked the other two, "Hey, did either of you guys shit
in your pants?" Dusty and Loner both replied, "Not me Jake." "Well, I smell
shit, and I think it's coming from one of you guys," said Jake. They walked
a little further before Jake turned to Loner and asked, "Are you SURE you
didn't shit in your pants?" "Well Jake," said Loner, "don't ya' think I'd
know if I shit in my pants?" With that, Jake knocked Dusty to the ground,
untied his rope belt and pulled down his overalls. Right there in the
middle of the seat of his pants was a flattened out shit, lookin' like a
big old dried out brown pancake. "I thought you said you didn't shit in
your pants!" cried Jake. "Ohhh," replied Dusty, "I thought you meant
TODAY ..."

After six months prospecting for gold, a miner visited the local trading
post desperate for a woman. "Nothing much around here," the storekeeper
told him, "only the odd squaw, or old Joe the stablehand." "Can't take
no injun wimen, sure as hell ain't taking no man," the parched miner croaked
in disgust as he stamped out the door. Three months later, the miner was
back, was made the same offer, and again refused. By his third visit, the
miner was absolutely determined to find some sex. "Listen," he told the
storekeeper, "I ain't got no time to go searching for no injun wimen.
I'll have to settle for old Joe." "Cost you thirty dollars," the store-
keeper replied, "Thats ten for me, ten for old Joe, and ten for the cook."
Feeling cheated, the miner said, "What the hell does the cook have to do
with it?!" "Well," continued the storekeeper, "it takes two of us to hold
old Joe down. You see, old Joe ain't too keen on men either ..."

dick through the wall. A pair of warm lips wrapped around his member, and he
proceeded to get the blow job of his life! This went on for a week before,
one night, nothing happened. So the guy went to the captain and asked him
what the problem was. "Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you," said the captain,
"it's your turn to go into the hut ..."

     There was once a rich man who knew that, within a month, he would die
of cancer. So he invited three of his best friends, an engineer, a doctor,
a lawyer, to a bequest. The dying man said, "I have worked hard for my
entire life, for money, and as such I have decided that I want to be buried
with it. However, since the state prohibits all objects from being placed
in the casket, except for the deceased and one set of clothing, I will
need your help."  He continued, "Therefore, I will give each of you $1
million. On the day of the funeral, each of you will approach the casket
and secretly throw the money into the casket." The three friends took
the money and left. A month later, after the funeral, the three remaining
friends gathered at a bar to drown their sorrow. The engineer broke the
silence and said, "I have to confess. Times have been hard lately, so I
kept $10,000 for myself. I can't believe that I was so weak, I'm truly
sorry ..." The doctor, moved by his friend's confession, also spoke up.
"I've also betrayed our friend's memory," he sobbed. "My wife wanted
another BMW, so I took out $40,000 ..." After they settled down, both
the engineer and the doctor looked at the lawyer, who had yet to reveal
any indiscretions. The lawyer immediately got indignant at the stares he
was getting and said, "Don't think that because I am a lawyer that I would
rip him off like you two did." He continued, "I did my part - I threw in
a check for the full $1 million."

One day a indian squaw came across a new water well that had some of the
best water that she had found. She collected some of the water and took it
back to her husband. The Squaw said, "I have found new well with good water.
Have some." Her husband responded, "Me very thirsty; let me taste water."
He gulped the water down and said, "Water very good, but strong brave
husband still thirsty. Squaw fetch more water." The squaw fetched more
water from the new well, returned some time later, and said, "Here is more
water for brave husband." Her husband replied, "Big brave very thirsty,"
as he gulped down the water. He then said, "Water very good, but strong
brave -still- thirsty. Squaw fetch more water." So the squaw went back to
the well, returned some time later, and said to her husband, "I could not
get more water for brave husband." Her husband responded, "Why is that? Has
new well already gone dry?" The squaw replied, "No, white man sitting on
well."

Harold suspected his wife of playing around on the side, so one day he took
the afternoon off and comes home extra early. He entered his apartment,
which was on the 3rd floor, and started looking around. Upon entering the
bedroom he found his wife laying in bed. On her nightstand was a lit ciga-
rette. In the ashtray on his nightstand, on the other side of the bed,
there was another lit cigarette. Harold went beserk. After beating his wife
upside the head, he proceeded to search the apartment. It was not long
before he spotted a pair of hands hanging on the window sill, outside
the bedroom. He grabbed one of the ashtrays and pounded on the hands until
the battered fingers let go. Despite falling thirty feet the cuckold was
still alive and trying to crawl away. Now worried that he might go to jail
if his wife's lover lived to tell the police, Harold ran into the kitchen
and pushed the refrigerator into the bedroom and out the window. He was
so worked up, and the refrigerator was so heavy, that the effort of
pushing it out the window gave poor Harold a heart attack, and he died.

When Harold arrived at the Pearly Gates, St. Peter asked Harold what had
happened to him. Harold told his story, and Peter let him in. Soon there-
after a second guy showed up for admission to Heaven. When St. Peter asked
him why he was there, he said "I don't know what happened, I was a window
cleaner. I was working on the fifth floor of an apartment building when
my safety strap broke and I fell. I caught myself on the ledge of a 3rd
floor apartment. Then somebody smashed my hands and made me fall to the
sidewalk. I was stunned, but okay. The next thing I know, I look up and
there is a refrigerator coming down at me ..." He too was allowed in.
It was not long before a third potential angel approached the gates.
St. Peter asked the third guy, "What happened to you?" The guy said,
"I don't know. I was sitting in this refrigerator minding my own
business ..."

Dear Mr. Smith,

     We regret to inform you that we have rejected your application to model
and represent our product - TROJAN CONDOMS. Although your general apearance
is not displeasing, our Board of Directors feel that your wearing our pro-
duct does not portray a positive, romantic image of our product. A loose,
baggy and wrinkled condom is not considered romantic. We did admire your
efforts to firm it up by using polygrip, but even then it slipped off
before we could get a photograph taken. We would like to note, however,
that we have never seen a penis that looked like a bicycle grip until now.

     We appreciate your interest and thank you for your time. We will
retain your application for future consideration, if by some chance we
decide there is a market for micro-mini condoms. We send our greetings
deepest sympathy to your wife and/or girlfriend.

Very truly yours,

Jack Meoff
President

An polack walked into a travel agency and demanded the special Hawaiian
tour. The travel agent said, "I'm sorry, I handle Caribbean cruises. Hawaiin
tours are just through the door." So the polack opened the door. As he was
walking through the door, someone hit him over the head, knocking him uncon-
cious, stole his wallet, and threw him in the dumpster.  Later that day,
an aggie walked into the same travel agency and asked for the same Hawaiian
tour. Again, the travel agent explained that he handled cruises and sent
the aggie to the office next door. As soon as the aggie opened the door,
he got the same treatment. When the polack and the aggie woke up, they found
themselves floating in the middle of the ocean on a small raft. The aggie
looked at polack and asked, "I wonder if they'll fly us back?" The polack
responded knowingly, "They didn't last year ..."

One morning, the county sheriff was having a cup of coffee at the donut shop,
when all of a sudden a kid on a tricycle zoomed down the street. The sheriff
was so startled he spilled coffee all over himself, but the tricycle was gone
before anything could be done; it had been going at least 50. Later that
afternoon while the sheriff was enjoying a nap behind a billboard, the
same boy zoomed by again, doing about 70. The sheriff was again startled,
but decided he ought to do something before the kid sideswiped a semi.
So the sheriff set up a speed trap. No sooner had the sheriff finished,
than the kid came screaming down the sidewalk about 80! The sheriff spun
gravel and hauled ass after the speeding tricycle. The kid immediately
pulled over. "Did ya'll know thah ya'll wus SPEE-ding?" drawled the sheriff,
"And how did ya'll git thah tri-CEE-cle tuh go thah fast anyway?" The little
boy replied, "There's a little motor under the seat." "Like hail!" said
the sheriff, who proceeded to look under the seat. "Wuhl I'll be damned!"

Three gays are driving around San Francisco, when they had to stop for a
red light. Unfortunately, the large semi-trailer behind them burned out
his breaks on the steep downgrade and slammed into the back of the gays'
car. Bruce, the gay who was driving, looked at his buddies and asked if
they were okay. One friend, Harvey, complained of a sore neck. So Bruce
jumped out of the car, stormed up to the truck, and pounded on the door
saying, "I hope you've got good insurance buddy, my friend is really hurt!"
The truck driver, a real road hog, rolled down the window and said, "Suck

his car. "We're in luck fellas," said Bruce, "he wants to settle out of
court ..."

A young man, in love with a girl he wanted to make love to, was so ashamed
of his small penis that he was afraid of bringing up the question, or of
letting her see him naked. One dark night he drove her around in his car
and parked in a dark lane. As they kissed, he surreptitiously opened his
fly and put his weapon in her hand. "Thanks," she said, "But you know I
don't smoke."

     One night, Luke Duke picked up Daisy at the bar. They were on their
way to the local lover's lane when a traffic light changed from green to
red. Luke gunned the engine and sped through the red light. Curious, Daisy
asked, "Why did you do that?" Luke just said, "Don't worry, my brother does
it all the time." At the next intersection, the light changed again. Again
they sped through it. Daisy, starting to reconsider the wisdom of being in
the same vehicle as Luke, asked, "Why do you keep doing that?" "Don't
worry," replied Luke, "my brother drives like this." At the next inter-
section, the last one in the town with a light, the light turned green.
As all the other pick-up trucks started moving, Luke screeched to a rubber
burning halt. Daisy, by now in a panic, screamed, "What are you doing?!"
Replied Luke, "I have to be careful; my bother might be coming the other
way ..."

One night at a bar in San Francisco, a sailor and marine, both on shore
leave, started arguing about which service was better, who could drink more,
who had the bigger dick, etc. Well, needless to say, the bartender stepped
in and said, "Okay, let's settle this once and for all; whip em' out!" So
the two guys whipped their dicks out and laid them on the bar. Just then
a fag walked in. The bartender told the two guys to hold on for a sec while
he served the fag. The bartender asked the fag what he'd have. "Well, I was
going to have a white wine spritzer," the fag lisped as he looked down
the bar at the two guys with their cranks hanging out, "but now I think
I'll have the buffet."

said, "Let me see if I got this right. That's two bloods and a blood-lite?"

     Three yuppers, Sven, Ole and Karl, were sitting in a boat fishing.
It was a grey autumn morning, a light drizzle fell from the skies and the
lake reflected like the color of old pewter. The fishermen became dazed,
hypnotized by the mesmerizing act of watching thier lines. Karl fell out
of the boat. Five minutes went by ... Ten minutes went by ... Fifteen
minutes went by ... "Hey," said Sven, "where's Karl?" "Oh My God!" cried
Ole, "He's fallen into the lake!" So Sven stripped off his raincoat and
heavy jacket and leapt into the water, diving frantically to find his
missing pal. A minute later, Sven surfaced and heaved the limp and dripping
wet lost fisherman into the boat. Ole immediately began CPR. "Hey," said Ole
as he came up for air, "I don't remember Karl's breath being -that- bad."
"Hey," scowled Sven, "Come to think of it, I don't remember Karl being
dressed in a snowmobile suit either ..."

Two maintenance men, Pat O'Brien and Ivan Petrovich were working around on
the launch pad of the space shuttle one day, when Pat noticed some fuel
leaking from one of the o-ring seals. Ivan immediately notified mission
control, which instructed Ivan and Pat to try to contain the fuel spill
until NASA could figure out what else to do. So, Pat and Ivan started
putting buckets, cans, jars, and whatever else they could find, under the
leaking engines. After several hours (it took the NASA bureaucracy -long-
time to figure out who to blame) Ivan decided to taste the fuel.

Ivan: "Hey, Pat! Take a sip of this shit. It ain't half-bad."

Pat: "Are you crazy?"

Ivan: "No, really. It's kinda like vodka or something."

Pat: "Hey, you're right! This -is- good stuff ..."

Ivan: "Yea, and I think I'm getting a good buzz off it too ..."

So, Pat and Ivan continued to consume their new-found source of entertain-
ment. The fuel spill was quickly disposed of. The next morning, Ivan got a
phone call.

Ivan: "Hello?"

Pat: "Hey Ivan, how are feeling?"

Ivan: "Pretty good, actually. I don't have a hangover or nuthin'!"

Pat: "Have you gone to the bathroom yet?"

Ivan: "No, why?"

Pat: "Because I'm calling you from Australia ..."

     One night a travelling salesman found that he had stayed on the road
too long, and that he was stranded in the middle farm country with no place
to sleep. Naturally, he sought refuge at the nearest farm house. The farmer
agreed to let him stay, but only as long as "you don't sneak upstairs to my
daughter's room." The salesman promised but, as with all travelling sales-
men, he found it hard to resist the lure of a farmer's daughter.

     In the middle of the night the salesman crept up the stairs to the
daughter's room, where he found her naked, spread-eagled on the bed. The
salesman immediately dove between her legs and started eating her out. He
had just gotten his tongue wet, when he got a mouthful of rice. Undeterred,
he spit out the rice and resumed his tongue lashing. Once again, he got
a mouthful of rice. Puzzled, but still horny, he started eating her out
again. When he got another mouthful of rice, and still no response from
the daughter, the salesman gave up and went back to bed.

     The next morning the salesman told the farmer, "I have to confess:
Last night I went up to your daughter's room." "That's okay son," replied
the kindly, old farmer. "And I have to confess that I had oral sex with
her," continued the salesman. "I ain't got a quarrel with that, son,"
replied the kindly, old farmer. "But I have just one question," concluded
the salesman, "Why is it that every time I ate her, I kept getting a mouth-
ful of rice?" "Oh that?" said the kindly, old farmer, "Them's maggots -
she's been dead ten years."

After months of scrimping and bargain hunting to make ends meet, a woman
begged her tight-fisted husband to give her some shopping money. "Can't you
just give me an extra ten dollars so I can buy a roast?" she asked. Her
husband pulled a ten-dollar bill from his pocket and held it up to the
mirror. "See the money in the mirror? That's yours. And this," he said,
putting the ten-spot back in his pocket, "is mine." The next evening, he
went home to find the table filled with a Roman feast of glazed ham, stuffed
hens, fresh fruit, steaming veggies, baked alaska, etc, etc, etc. "Where
did you get the money for all this?" the husband barked. His wife took him
to the mirror. "See this body in the mirror? That's yours. And this one," she
said, pulling off her dress, "is the grocer's."

asked her to explain its origin, she stammered, "Well ... you see ... uh
... my boyfriend goes to Yale, and ... er ... well, he likes to make love
with his sweater on." "That's no problem," said the doctor, as he gave her
a tube 'Rash-Away.' A few days later, a second young lady went to see the
same doctor. When the doctor started examining the second young lady, he
noticed she had an "H"-shaped rash on her chest. When he asked her to
explain its origin, she stammered, "Well ... you see ... uh ... my boy-
friend goes to Harvard, and ... well, he likes to make love with his
sweater on." "That's no problem," said the doctor, as he gave her a tube
of 'Rash-Away.' A few weeks later, a third young lady went to the same
doctor. When the doctor started checking her over, he noticed she had an
"M"-shaped rash. "Don't tell me," said the doctor, "Your boyfriend goes
to Michigan and he likes to make love with his sweater on ..." "Well, not
exactly," said the woman. "My girlfriend goes to Wisconsin and ..."

to go up in a plane, jump out, and see which parachute performed better.
So they both went up and jumped out of the plane at the same time. The yupper
pulled his ripcord first; the parachute opened and he began drifting slowly
towards the ground. Then the aggie pulled his ripcord, but nothing happened!
The aggie plummeted past the yupper. Cutting his parachute risers, the
yupper yelled, "Oh, so you wanna -RACE- now, eh?"

Harry went to a doctor to have his knees examined. "What are you doing
that's making your knees so raw?" asked the doctor. "Well ... I like to
do it doggie style, doc, and ... well ... I just can't get enough," answered
Harry. Concerned, the doctor advised Harry to "Take it a little easier."
Two weeks later, Harry went back for a follow-up exam; his knees were even
worse - dripping puss and blood. Aghast, the doctor had a hard time con-
trolling his temper. "What the hell are you doing?" said the doctor. "I told
you doc," Harry meekly replied, "I love to do it doggie style." The doctor,
his anger spent, said, "Damn, son, can't you turn her over?" Surprised,
Harry replied, "Hell no doc, have you ever smelled a dog's breath?"

     Two travelling salesmen, Jack and Bob, were driving through along a
desolate stretch of Kansas highway when their car broke down. It was getting
late, and the only building for miles around was a weather-battered old gas
station a mile up the road. Jack and Bob went up to the adjacent trailor and
knocked on the door. A knarled, old, baggy-titted widow answered the door.
"Ma'am," said Jack, "Our car broke down. Do you think we could stay here
tonight?" "Well," said the widow, "I only have one bed. One of you can sleep
with me, but the other will have to sleep on the porch. Y'all decide who
sleeps where ..."

     Jack and Bob both knew that whoever slept in the widow's bed would have
to screw her ugly, gnarled body, so they flipped a quarter to see who got
the dubious honor. Bob lost and so he slept on the porch. Jack tentatively
crawled under the sheets. The widow lost no time tearing Jack's clothes off
(something he had conveniently neglected to do). "Wait a minute," said Jack,
"I like to do it in the dark." The widow agreed and so Jack got up to turn
out the lights. That was when he noticed a bucket full of corn beside the
bed. When he crawled back under the covers, Jack grabbed an ear of corn and
started screwing the widow with it. Thw widow, being rather 'wide,' did not
notice the difference - she started moaning and screaming. Bob, sleeping
outside, heard all the commotion and crept up to the window so he could
better hear the action.

     Inside, every time the corn got soggy, Jack threw it out the window.
The widow, who hadn't had a man in decades, was insatiable and so the corn-
screwing went on all night. The next morning, their car repaired, Jack and
Bob were driving along, when Bob started giggling. "What's so funny?" asked
Jack. Bob started guffawing. "What the hell is so funny?" shouted Jack. Bob,
finally regaining control of himself, said, "Last night while you had to
screw that ugly widow, I was a laying back eating buttered corn!"

Marvin was the world's oldest virgin. After years and years of putting ads
in singles' papers and enlisting in dating services, he was nearly penni-
less. In desperation, he went to a whorehouse. "Lady," Marvin said to the
madam, "I'm desperate. I need to get laid - and all I got is this quarter!"
The madam, like all madams, had a heart of gold. She said, "I'm here to
help you. Go see the girl in the last room ... And keep the change." So,
Marvin went down the hall to the last room. There he found a fat, ugly
whore, naked, spread-eagled on the bed. But Marvin didn't care, he just
wanted to screw. So, he tore off his clothes and dove between her legs.
Marvin had just begun to the eat out the whore when he got a mouthfull
of beef. So intent was Marvin on getting laid, he thought nothing of it;
he spit out the beef and resumed tongue lashing the whore. A minute later
Marvin got a mouthfull of carrots. Even though he was starting to get a
little worried, Marvin was still more horny than worried - he spit out
the carrots and returned to eating the whore. Within seconds, Marvin got
a mouthfull of peas. Spitting out the peas he yelled, "What's the matter?
Are you sick or something?" "No," replied the whore, "but the guy before
you was ..."

The foreman at the sawmill wasn't eager to hire the blind man because of
the obvious risks involved, but the guy begged for a chance. "You'll see,"
he said. "Just put me downstream of the saw and and I'll smell the type and
length of the lumber and stack it accordingly."

So the foreman agreed to give it a shot. Positioning the blind man, he
sent down a twelve-foot piece of pine. "Ahhh ..." said the man, breathing
in deeply, "pine, twelve-foot." And he stacked it in the right place. The
foreman repeated the test with oak and redwood, fir and mohagony, and the
blind guy didn't miss once. Then, getting a sly look on his face, the fore-
man sent for the office secretary, old Mabel, and told her to hike up her
skirts and ride down the conveyor belt.

Mabel rode through, faceup, right past the blind man. Sniffing furiously
and looking very puzzled, he asked that the last piece of wood be sent
through again. The foreman complied, but not before telling Mabel, skirt
still up, to turn over. After a few moments of reflection, the blind man
turned to the foreman with a with a triumphant smile. "I've got it!" he
proclaimed, "That's the shithouse door from a tuna boat!"

           There once was a guy named Benny. He was sitting in the bleachers at Fenway
one day when Wade Boggs hit a homerun. He told the guy next to him, Eddie,
that he knew everyone. Eddie seriously doubted this and bet twenty dollars
Benny did not know Wade Boggs. So, after the game, they went to the club-
house where the great third baseman shook Benny's hand and invited him out
for beers. Eddie was impressed, but not satisfied; he bet $1000 that Benny
did not know the President of the United States. So, Benny and Eddie went
to the White House, where the President invited them to a State Dinner
honoring the Queen of England. Eddie was astonished! Still he was doubtful
that Benny knew -EVERYONE-. He bet a million dollars that Benny did not know
the Pope. So, Benny and Eddie went to St. Peter's Square in Rome. There the
Pope was saying mass for 100,000 people. Benny walked up and stood behind
the Pope. After the mass, just as the Pope embraced Benny warmly, Benny
noticed Eddie fainting. Benny rushed over to Eddie and woke him up with
smelling salts. "What happened Eddie?" Benny asked. Eddie replied, "I was
surprised when you knew Wade Boggs, and shocked when you knew the President,
but when a guy tapped me on the shoulder and asked, 'Who is that guy with
Benny?'..."

John and Mike entered the Boston Marathon. After they'd been running for

"That's Bill Rodgers - he won the race a couple of years ago." A few minutes

A man visited his doctor and complained of feeling bad. Because there were
no apparent medical problems, the doctor gave the patient a thorough exam;
he found nothing wrong. After thinking on the situation for a few minutes,
the doctor asked the patient about his diet. "Tell me what you typically
eat for breakfast," the doctor said. "Oh, a pound of bacon, a dozen eggs,
a loaf of toasted bread, two or three pots of coffee. And maybe six or
seven dounuts if I'm really hungry." "That's a pretty big breakfast," the
doctor said. "What do you eat for lunch?" "Nine or ten hamburgers, four or
five milkshakes, and a pie or two." The doctor was amazed. "And what do
you have for dinner?" "That's my big meal," said the patient. "I usually
have three or four helpings of salad, four or five steaks, five or six
baked potatoes, eight or nine dinner rolls and five or six pots of coffee."
The doctor shook his head and said, "Drop your pants again; then turn
around and bend over." The man did so and after the doctor looked closely
he told the guy, "There's your problem! You have only one asshole ..."

Three men - Myron the lawyer, Vinnie the teamster, and J.D. the aggie -
proposed marriage to an eligible young lady. Mary couldn't decide which
proposal to accept (Myron had a prestigious job, Vinnie was a manly man,
and J.D. the aggie was filthy rich), so she told them, "We'll have a con-
test. I'll marry whoever brings me the most ping-pong balls." A couple of
days later, Myron the lawyer came back with an attache case full of ping-
pong balls. "Would you please marry me, please?" Myron begged. Mary was
about to accede to Myron when they heard a rumble outside. Vinnie the
teamster huffed into Mary's apartment and threw open the curtain. There,
on the lawn, were his buddies unloading crate after crate of ping-pong
balls from a huge semi. "Yo," growled Vinnie, "Why don't youse marry me?"
Totally surprised, Mary told Vinnie the teamster, "Well it looks like it's
going to be you and me, but I want to be fair; we have to wait for J.D." It
was a long wait. Several months later, J.D. the aggie showed up. His clothes
were in rags, his body a mass of cuts and bruises, but J.D. was carrying two
HUGE round objects on his shoulders. "What happened to you?" Mary asked J.D.
"I waited all this time," she cried, "and you didn't even bring me any ping-
pong balls!" "Ping-pong balls?" said J.D. the aggie, "I thought you said
King Kong's balls ..."

Three recently deceased college graduates, one from Harvard, one from Baylor
and the last from Texas A&M, showed up at the Pearly Gates. The Gates were
in desperate need of repair, so St. Peter asked the three potential angels
to make a bid on the repair project. Since they all agreed, St. Peter gave
each of them a copy of the specs and said, "Study them overnight and have
your bids ready in the morning." The next morning, St. Peter asked the
three, "What are your bids?" The aggie bid $3,000. "What's the breakdown?"
St. Peter asked. "A thousand for labor, a thousand for materials, and a
thousand for overhead and profit," replied the aggie. St. Peter jotted down
the figures and asked the Harvard man, "What's your bid?" After the Harvard
man replied "Six thousand" St. Peter asked him for the breakdown. "Two for
labor, two for material and two for overhead and profit." St. Peter, frown-
ing at the second bid, turned to the Baylor grad and asked, "Can you do any
better?" "Nine thousand," said the Baylor grad. "NINE thousand?!" thundered
St. Peter, "What is YOUR breakdown?" The Baylor grad confidently replied,
"Three for you, three for me and three to get the aggie to do it."

Early one spring, a saleswoman's car broke down in the middle of Northern
Michigan. After miles of walking, she found a farmhouse with two men sitting
on the front porch. "My car broke down; can I stay here tonight?" the sales-
woman asked the yuppers. "No problem," said Sven. "But you have to do a
favor for us, eh?" said Ole. The saleswoman agreed, adding "But you have
to wear these rubbers to keep me from getting pregnant." So the night
passed, and all concerned had a great amount of fun. The next day the sales-
woman got her car fixed and continued on her way. That fall, while they were
cutting wood, Sven turned to Ole and asked, "You know, what do we care if
that lady gets pregnant, eh?" "You know Sven," replied Ole, "I think you're
right. Why don't we take the rubbers off?"

Three friends got together and went to Mexico for a holiday. While they
were there they were picked up for buying and smoking pot and were sent
before a firing squad. The Federales lined up the three young Texans and
put blindfolds on them. The boy from Rice thought 'I must do something to
get out of this,' so he jerked off his blindfold and yelled, "Tornado!"
When the firing squad looked up, he ran away. The boy from Houston, not
thinking quite as quickly, jerked off his blindfold and yelled, "Cyclone!"
When the firing squad looked up, he ran away also. The aggie heard all
this going on and thought 'This will really fool them,' so he jerked off

for their hunting licenses. After showing the gays displayed the required
documents, the warden picked up a duck, stuck his finger up the its ass,
and announced, "You know this is a wood duck? You got a wood duck hunting
license, eh?" When one hunter produced a wood duck hunter's license, the
game warden stuck his finger up another duck's ass and announced, "This
is a mallard. You got a mallard hunting license, eh?" As another hunter
produced his mallard hunter's license, he asked the warden, "Why am I
being subjected to this abuse?" "Where you from, hoser?" asked the warden.
Whereupon the hunter turned around, bent over, and lisped, "Stick your
finger up there and find out for yourself."

A woman was unable to conceive, so she went to her doctor. The doctor told
her about the latest medical discovery, and told her to swallow three ball
bearings. The very next day, the woman got pregnant. Not only was she preg-
gers, but she was expecting triplets! Nine months later, she had two daugh-
ters and a son - one for each ball bearing. Twelve years after that, the
first daughter came running up to her and said, "Mommy mommy, I was doing
a pee in the toilet, and a little ball bearing fell out!" The mother
thought that her daughter had started menstruating, so she replied, "Don't
worry. I know all about it, and everything will be fine." A week after that,
the second daughter came running up to her mother and said, "Mommy mommy,
I was doing a pee in the toilet, and a little ball bearing fell out!" The
mother thought that her second daughter was also becomming a woman, so she
replied, "Don't worry. I know all about it, and everything will be fine."
A week after that, the only son came running up to his mother and said,
"Hey mom ..." The mother interrupted, and said, "Don't tell me ... You were
going to the bathroom, and a little ball bearing fell out?" "No, I was
upstairs playing with myself and I shot the cat!"

Feeling lucky, he pulled over and, like the suave dude he was, leaned out

It was every truck driver's dream come true. "Hey, no problem," he said,
"But you got to give me head the whole way." The hitchhiker agreed. Cleve-

The following quotes taken from the Toronto News on July 26, 1977, are
actual statements from insurance forms where car drivers tried to summarize
accident details in as few words as possible. Such instances of faulty writ-
ing serve to confirm that incompetency can be highly entertaining ...

1. Coming home I drove into the wrong house and collided with a tree I
   don't have.

2. The other car collided with mine without giving warning of its intent.

3. I collided with a stationary truck coming the other way.

4. In my attempt to kill a fly, I drove into a telephone pole.

5. I had been shopping for plants all day and was on my way home. As I
   reached an intersection, a hedge sprang up, obscuring my vision and I
   did not see the other car.

6. I had been driving for forty years when I fell asleep at the wheel and
   had an accident.

7. I was on my way to the doctor with rear end trouble when my universal
   joint gave way causing me to have an accident.

8. My car was legally parked as it backed into the other vehicle.

9. As I approached the intersection a sign suddenly appeared in a place
   where no sign had ever appeared before. I was unable to stop in time
   to avoid the accident.

10. I told the police I was not injured, but upon removing my hair, I found
    that I had a fractured skull.

11. I was sure the old fellow would never make it to the other side of the
    road when I struck him.

12. I saw a slow-moving, sad-faced old gentleman as he bounced off the hood
    of my car.

13. The indirect cause of the accident was a little guy in a small car with
    a big mouth.

14. I was thrown from my car as it left the road, and was later found in a
    ditch by some stray cows.

15. A pedestrian hit me and went under my car.

16. I thought my window was down, but I found out it was up when I put my
    head through it.

17. To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front, I struck the pedestrian.

18. The guy was all over the road. I had to swerve a number of times before
    I hit him.

19. The pedestrian had no idea which way to run, so I ran over him.

20. An invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my car and vanished.

21. A truck backed through my windshield into my wife's face.

22. I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother-in-law,
    and headed over the embankment.

(MY DOG "Sex")

Usually, everyone who has a dog either calls it 'Rover' or 'Fifi' or some-
thing. I called mine 'Sex.' Well, 'Sex' is a very embarrassing name. One
day I took Sex for a walk and he ran away from me. I spent hours looking
for that dog. A cop came along and asked me what I was doing in this alley
at 4:00 A.M. I said, "I'm looking for Sex." My case comes up next Thursday.

One day I went to city Hall to get a dog licence for Sex. The clerk asked
me what I wanted. I told him I wanted a license for Sex. He said, "I'd like
to have one, too." Then I said, "But this is a dog." And he said, "I don't
care how she looks." Then I said, "You don't understand, I've had Sex since
I was two years old." He replied, "You must have been a strong boy."

When I decided to get married, I told the minister that I wanted to have
Sex at the wedding. He told me to wait until after the wedding. I said,
"But Sex is a big part of my life - my whole lifestyle revolves around
Sex." He said he didn't want to hear about my personal life and would not
marry us in his church. I told him everyone coming to the wedding would
enjoy having Sex there. The next day we were married by the Justice of the
Peace. My family is barred from the church.

My wife and I took the dog along with us on the honeymoon. When I checked
into the motel I told the clerk, "I want a room for my wife and a special
room for Sex." The clerk said, "Every room in the motel is for Sex." Then
I said, "You don't understand- Sex keeps me awake at night." And the clerk
said, "Me, too." One day I told my friend that I had Sex on T.V. He said,
"Show-off." I told him it was a contest and he told me I should have sold
tickets.

When my wife and I separated we went to court to fight for custody of the
dog. I said, "Your  honor, I had Sex before I was married." And the Judge
said. "Me, too." When I told him that after I was married Sex left me,
he said, "Me, too." Well, now I've been thrown  in jail, been married,
divorced and had more trouble with that dog than I ever gambled for. Why
just the other day when I went for my first session with the psychiatrist
and she said, "What seems to be the trouble?" I replied, "Sex died and left
my life. It's like losing a best friend and it's so lonely." The doctor
said, "Look. You and I both  know that Sex isn't man's best friend - So
GET YOURSELF A DOG!"

One day Miss Smith told her class, "Today we're going to use the word
'definitely' in a sentence. Nancy?" Nancy said, "The sky is definitely
blue." Miss Smith corrected her, "No - sometimes it's overcast and the sky
is gray. And at night the sky is black. The sky isn't definitely blue.
Lenny?" Lenny said, "Ummm ... the grass is definitely green." Miss Smith
corrected Lenny also, "No - sometimes the grass is dead and brown. The
grass isn't definitely green." So Dirty Ernie jumped up and asked, "When
you fart does it ever have lumps in it?" Miss Smith, taken somewhat aback,
stuttered, "Heavens, no!" So Ernie replied, "Then I definitely shit my
pants!"

One day Marshal Dillon saw a cowboy dunking an old women's head in a horse
trough! The Marshal got upset and went over where this was happening.
"You best stop that, boy!" he warned, "Tain't nice what you're doing there!"
The cowboy replied, "Mind your own business. This is -MY- mother and I'll do
what I want ..." The cowboy continued to slam the women's head in the dirty
horse trough. Marshal Dillon was getting seriously pissed, "Look here, boy,
I'm gonna have to run you in, you don't stop that!" Fixing the Marshal with
a withering glare, the cowboy replied, "Mind your own damn business! She's
my mother and I'll do what I want!" By this time the Marshall was very pissed
- he hadn't had someone talk to him like that since he was a wet-behind-the-
ears deputy. He started towards the unruly cowboy, trying to slap the cuffs
on him, when the cowboy let go of the elderly woman and punched the Marshall
right between the eyes! As soon as the stunned Marshal hit the ground, the
cowboy jumped on his horse and galloped out of town. Marshall Dillon wobbled
to his feet and yelled, "Come back here, you cop-socking mother dunker!"

Two construction workers were working on the 58th floor of a new high-rise.
One of them looked at the other and said, "I'll be right back - I have to
go take a piss." His buddy said, "Hang on a minute. By the time you get the
elevator up here, go all the way down to the street, find a porta-shitter,
and get back, it's going to take at least a thirty minutes. Why don't we
get that board over there, push it part of the way over the edge, I'll
stand on this end, and you walk out and let loose." The construction worker
who was turning yellow immediately agreed. As he was standing on the board
relieving himself, the phone rang and the guy standing on the board stepped
off to answer it. At the inquest to his co-worker's death, the worker was
very distraught and was unable to assist in what happened. The police started
asking for witnesses when a little old lady walked up and said, "I saw him
fall, officer. I think it may have some to do with some kind of homosexual
act!" "That's a pretty serious accusation ma'am," the cop sternly replied,
"What makes you say that?" The old lady replied, "Well, as he was falling,
all the way down he was holding on to his penis, screaming 'Where did that
little cocksucker go?'"

A guy walked into a bar and, with a very despondent look on his face, ordered
a bourbon - straight up. The bartender set the drink down and, to his sur-

mer's jacket and onto the bar. The customer groaned and just put his head
down on the bar in total frustration. The little man glared at the barten-
der, took a sip of the drink and spit it out on the bar. "What the hell is
this donkey piss you call bourbon, you fat-bellied jerk!" the little man
bellowe as he turned and swaggered down the top of the bar, kicking ashtrays
out of his way and glaring at everyone. He stopped in front of another custo-
mer and said, "What are -YOU- lookin' at dicknose?!" He glared at everyone
in the bar again. The bartender looked at the guy that brought the little
man in with him and growled, "Where the hell did you find him?" The despon-
dent one sighed, "Its a long story ... I was vacationing in Ireland, found
a four-leaf clover, and was given one wish. So, I wished for a 14" prick
and ... well ... there he is."

After a long and particularly arduous cattle drive, a cowboy wandered into
Dodge to get a hot meal, a beer, and a bath. The cowboy headed for the
nearest restaurant to have dinner. The only vacant seat in the restaurant
was next to a refined, educated and wealthy looking young lady of about
twenty-one years. He couldn't help but overhear her ordering. "I'll have
breast of virgin fowl - make sure it's virgin - catch it yourself and
garnish it with onions - young spring onions. Then I'll have a cup of coffee
- not too strong and not too sweet. Oh yes, and waiter, -PLEASE- open the
windows, I think I smell a horse - there must be a cowboy in the room."
Completely pissed-off and not to be outdone, the cowboy placed his order:
"I'll have a duck. A well-fucked duck. Fuck it yourself and garnish it with
horse shit. Bring me a cup of coffee, strong as Texas mule piss and fart
the foam off. Yeah, and podnuh, knock the walls down - I smell cunt, there

years later, up came Einstein. "Prove to me you're Albert Einstein," said
the saint. Einstein proceeded to thoroughly explain the theory of relativity.

strolling along, wanting to be let through the gates of Heaven. "I need proof
of identity," said the saint. "But," sputtered Quayle, "I was the vice presi-
dent of the United States!" "Sorry," said the sympathetic saint," but every-
one needs proof. Even Beethoven and Albert Einstein needed proof." "Who?"
said Quayle. "Okay," said the saint, "You're in."

found another one and drank him dry. Afterwards, they flew the body over

vampires said to the other, "Do you hear that singing?" "I don't hear any

on flying. The next night same thing. "Hungry?" "Yes." "Chinese?" "No."

dry, fly the body over the same swamp, and dropped it. But this time as

put his hard won knowledge into use, he started raising chickens. The first
week he went to the hatchery and bought 200 chicks. The next week he came
back and bought 200 more. The third week, the same thing. Curious, the
hatchery man asked why the aggie came in every week to order 200 more
chicks. "Wahl," drawled the aggie, "Something seems to be wrong. Either ahm
planting them too deep - or too close together ..."

The rich ex-aggie reluctantly sent his son to Rice. In his first year the
son got a girl in trouble, so the fast thinking lad sent his dad a letter,
saying that a professor at Rice could teach Ol' Yeller to talk for $1,000.
Impressed, the ex-aggie sent the money and Ol' Yeller to his son. A few
months later, the son committed the same indiscretion so he wrote his dad
a letter, saying the professor wanted to teach the dog to read. Again the
ex-aggie came through with the money. At the end of the year, the rich ex-
aggie met his son at the backyard heliport. Lo and behold, there was the
son, but no Ol' Yeller! "Where's thuh dawg, son?" inquired the rich Texan.
"Yah know, Paw," said the son, "two nights ago Ol' Yeller and I were having
a chat while he was reading thuh paper. I said it sure would be good to come
bak home, and Ol' Yeller said 'Yeah, I miss the ranch too.' And he said he
wondered if the old man was still fooling around with the French maid. And
you know, Paw, I got so mad at that remark that I reached over and choked
that old dawg. Before I could control myself, Ol' Yeller had died." Quickly
the ex-aggie leaned forward and anxiously whispered in his son's ear, "Are
you sure that dawg is dead, son?"

a living. "Tim,"  she said, "What does your mother do all day?" Tim stood up
and said proudly, "She's a doctor." "That's wonderful. How about you Amy?"
said the teacher.  Amy shyly stood up, scuffed her feet, and said, "My
father is a mailman." "Thank you Amy. What about your father Ernie?" said
the teacher.  Dirty Ernie jumped up and proudly announced "My father plays
piano in a whorehouse!" The teacher was shocked and promptly changed the
subject to geography. Later that day she went to Dirty Ernie's house and
rang the bell. Ernie Senior answered the door. The teacher explained what

One sunday the Mother Superior called all the nuns together. "You know,"
she said, "I found a used condom in the here last night." All the nuns were
surprised, except one. They went, "Uhhhhh?" She went "Hee hee hee." The
Mother Superior continued, "That means there was a man here last night."
"Uhhhhh?" said the nuns. "Hee hee hee," went the lone nun. Again the Mother
Superior continued "You all know that's against the rules." Again all the
went "Uhhhhh?" Again the lone nun laughed. Finally, the MOther Superior
concluded, "And worst of all, the condom has a hole in it." All the nuns
went 'Hee hee hee!' while the lone nun said "Uhhhhh?"

A young nun at a convent had one too many sexual indiscretions, and turned up
pregnant. Scared, she told no one of this, and was thankful that the order
she belonged to wore loose, floor-length habits that would keep her secret
safe, possibly right up until the birth. And so it did, and upon the evening
when the contractions started, she rushed down into the basement, hoping that
no one would hear either her own moaning, or the cries of the newborn child.
After the birth, panic set in; she didn't know WHAT she should do with the
baby. If she were found with the child, she would be thrown out of the
order, with no place for food or shelter. Knowing that the Mother Superior
was a wise woman, and also having no other options, she placed the baby in a
basket, and quietly crept into the sleeping Mother's room in the pre-dawn
hours. She left the baby, and silently exited the sleeping chambers. At
sunrise, the Mother Superior awakened, and heard the baby as it was just
waking from a nap. She quickly looked over the side of her bed, at the child
in the basket, fell back in her bed with a sorrowful look, and dejectedly
sighed, "Oh, God! You can't even trust your own finger any more!"

Just before the big wedding day a groom's friends decided to throw him a
stag party. After many drinks, a naked girl jumped out of the big cake
and started dancing with the groom. The inebriated groom soon fell and broke
his woody on the floor. His buddies rushed him to the hospital where a
doctor examined the groom's injury. The doctor concluded that the groom had,
in layman's terms, fractured his penis. "Doc! Doc! That can't be true! I'm
getting married tommorow; what about my honeymoon?" "Well Mr. Smith, the
only thing that I can do is splint it. The swelling should go down in a
couple of days." And the doctor proceeded to take four tongue depressors,
placing one on each side of the groom's now crooked penis, and taped
around the whole affair to keep it all in place. The next day, the wedding
went off without a hitch. When the newlyweds got to the hotel that night,
the groom quickly excused himself into the bathroom. After an hour, he
finally emerged from the bathroom with his pajama bottoms on - he still
was not sure what to say. As he entered the bedroom he was greeted by the
sight of his new bride lying spread eagled on the bed. "Here you go
sweetheart," she cooed, "Pure untouched virgin wool - Unseen by any man
except you." "You think yours is new," he said whipping off his pajama
bottoms, "Mine is so new it's still in the crate!"

A man was golfing, and everything was going the usual way for his game, when
he came to the 16th hole and had a hole in one! As he reached in the hole
to get his ball, out came a genie. The genie said "I grant you one wish."
The man didn't take long to make his request, "I'd like to have the the
biggest cock in the world." POOF! His cock became so long that it drug
behind him two feet. He was so stunned by this that he couldn't go on with
his golf game. He went back to the clubhouse dragging his cock behind him.
Everyone in the clubhouse stared at him as he made his way to see the pro.
"Look what happened to me on the 16th hole!" he yelled at the club pro.
After explaining to the pro what had caused his elongated 'putter,' the
golfer asked the pro what he thought he could do to remedy the situation.
"Why don't you take this bucket of balls and go back to the 16th hole and
try to get another hole-in-one. Maybe then you'll get the genie back and
he can help you." So off the golfer went to the 16th hole. After hours of
hitting balls and not even coming close to getting a hole-in-one, lightning
finally struck twice. Just as the golfer reached in to retrieve his golf
ball, out popped the genie. "Don't tell me," said the genie, "I think I
know what you want this time. You want your cock shrunk back to normal,
right?" "No!" the golfer replied, "I want you to make my legs longer!"

his car and began screaming, "My BMW! My BMW!" A passing trucker stopped
to help and noticed the yuppie's laments. "Hey buddy!" the trucker shouted,
"Can't you see your arm's been torn off?" The yuppie paused, noticed the
trucker was correct and began shouting, ""My Rolex! My Rolex!"

shouted into it "... and you tell them that we won't accept less then fifty
thousand dollars, and don't even call me until you agree to that amount!"
Slamming the phone down, he stood up and greeted Mr. Jones, "Good Morning,

The man then asked her, "Well then, would you sleep with me for fifty
dollars?" The woman was shocked and replied indignantly, "What do you
think I am?!" "We've established that," the man said, "Now we're negotiating
the price!"

At the turn of the century, a cowboy was riding across the New Mexico desert
heading for Phoenix. He rode over a hill and saw an Indian lying on the
ground, naked with a hard on. Being a curious type, the cowboy rode over to
the Indian and asked just what he was doing. The Indian replied, "Me tellum
time." The cowboy was doubtful that the Indian could really tell the time,
so he asked, "What time is it?" The Indian replied that it was 10:05 in the
morning. The cowboy pulled out his pocket watch and sure enough it was
exactly 10:15! The stunned could do nothing but continue his ride west.
That afternoon the cowboy saw another Indian lying on the ground, naked with
a hard on. He rode up and asked "Injun, what are you doing laying there on
the ground?" The second Indian replied, "Me tellum time." The cowboy was
sure that this one was lying, but to humor him he said, "Okay, what time is
it?" The second indian said was about 3:45 in the afternoon. The cowboy
again looked at his pocket watch and sure enough it was exactly 3:45!
The now incredulous cowboy continued his ride west. Near sunset the cowboy
spied yet another Indian laying on his back. But this third indian was
vigorously masturbating. The cowboy rode up to him and said "I know you
ain't telling the time, so just what in tarnation do you think you're
doing?" The third Indian replied, "Me no tellum time - me windum clock!"

Three travelling salesmen had car trouble out in Kansas, so they walked to
a farmer's house. "The nearest gas station with a phone is 50 miles from
here," said the farmer, "but you can stay tonight in the guest room - just
don't stick your dicks in the three holes your bathroom wall." The salesmen
agreed, and went to their room. That night curiosity got the better of them.
The first salesman went for it. "Wow, this is great! It's the best I've
ever had!" moaned the first salesman. Hearing this, the second guy stepped
up next to the first and stuck his dick in the second hole. After a few
strokes, the second salesman said, "It's not great, but better than
nothin'." Hearing this the third salesman had to check things out for
himself. The third salesman had no sooner stuck his dick in the third hole
than he began screaming uncontrollably. In less than a minute, the farmer
burst into their room. The first salesman asked the farmer what was in the
holes."Well," replied the farmer, "the first one is my daughter, the second
one is my cow, and the third one is my milking machine - but don't worry,
it cuts off after 55 gallons ..."

undressed for the big occiasion. Bob turned to Alice and said, "I have to
be honest with you sweetheart, I have never done this before" Alice replied
"Don't worry Bob; I'll guide you through it." So Alice laid on the bed and
parted her legs. Pointing to her womanhood, Alice told Bob to insert his
penis here when it gets hard. Bob looked at Alice, and said, "No way! My
grandmother told me to stay away from those things 'cause they got teeth
and they bite!" Alice laughed, and said, "Oh, they do not! Here, take a
real close look. Do you see any teeth in there?" Bob got real close and
took a long, hard, look. Lifting his head, he replied, "Of course there's
no teeth in there, what did you expect with those rotten gums?"

INDOOR GOLF

1.  Each player will furnish is own equipment for play, normally one club
    and two balls.

2.  The course to be played must be approved by the owner of the hole.

3.  Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and
    keep the balls out of the hole.

4.  For the most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft.
    Course owners are permitted to check the stiffness of the shaft
    before play begins.

5.  Course owners have the right to restrict the length of the club in
    order to avoid damage to the hole.

6.  The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until
    the owner is satisfied. Failure to do so may result in being denied
    permission to play the course again.

7.  It is normally considered bad form to begin playing the hole
    immediately upon arriving at the course. The experienced player will
    usually admire the entire course, with special attention to the well
    formed bunkers.

8.  Players are cautioned not to mention any other courses they have
    played. Upset owners have been know to damage players' equipment for
    this reason.

9.  Players should assure themselves that the match has been properly
    scheduled - especially on a course being played for the first time.
    Previous players have been known to get irate if they find someone
    else playing what they considered their own private course.

10. Players should not assume that the course is in shape for play at
    all times. Some owners may be embarrassed if their course is
    temporarily under repair. The player is advised to use tact in
    this determination. More advanced players will find alternate
    means of play when this is the case.

11. It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play
    the same hole several times in one match.

12. Course owners shall be the judge as to who is the best player. It
    is considered bad form for a player to reveal his score, or even
    that he even played the course, to other players. Players who have
    contracted for exclusive rights to play a private course are
    cautioned that information reaching the owner that the player
    has played some other course, may result in the contract being
    canceled and a suit for damages instituted.

A polish couple got married. On their wedding night they couldn't figure

aggie. "Because she's a Lesbian!" the bartender said. "That don't bother
me!" exclaimed the aggie as he made his way to young woman's table. Taking
a seat, he asked her, "So, what part of Lesbia are you from?"

Having just finished his meal, the restaraunt customer was eagerly looking
forward to enjoying a good cup of coffee before he left. As the waiter
returned from the kitchen, the customer noticed that the waiter was holding
the cup in such a way that his thumb curled over the rim of the cup and was
actually submerged in the brew. The customer was irate, exclaiming, "What
the hell are you doing with your thumb in my coffee?!" The waiter looked
surprised, and somewhat embarassed, and said, "I'm sorry, sir, but I have
arthritis in my thumb - really bad, you see - and I wasn't even conscious
of having my thumb in your coffee. The warmth, you see, makes it feel SO
much better and ..." The customer cut the babbling waiter off, "If it's
warmth you want, why don't you just stick your thumb up your ass?!" The
waiter replied, "Oh, I do - when I'm in the kitchen!"

One day a man was playing golf by himself. He hit a tee shot into a sand
trap. While looking for his ball, he unearthed an antique lamp. He dusted
it off and a genie appeared. With a raised hand, the golfer stopped the
genie, saying, "I don't want anything. I'm happy with life as it is." No
matter what the genie said, the golfer could not be convinced to make even
one wish. The golfer played on, but the genie, having much experience in
these matters, knew what every man wants. The genie gave the golfer health,
wealth and a great sex life. A year later, the same man hit his golf ball
into the same sand trap. Looking for his ball, he again found the lamp.
As soon as the golfer picked up the lamp, the genie appeared. The man again
stopped the genie. The genie said, "Then, sir, please grant ME a wish and
answer some questions." The golfer agreed. "How is your health?" asked the
genie. "Unusually good this past year," said the man. Feeling better, the
genie asked, "How about your finances?" "I won the lottery several months
ago," said the golfer. "Excellent!" beamed the genie, "And how is your
love life?" "Not that it is any of your business," said the man, "But I
get it about twice a week." "Is that all?" asked the disappointed genie.
"Well," said the golfer, "I don't know about you, but I think that is
pretty darn good for a priest in a small parish!"

Once upon a time Little Red Riding Hood decided to visit her grandmother.
Red took a basket with everything she needed and set out on her trip through
the forest. While she was happily skipping along the forest trail, she came
across a very friendly squirrel. When the squirrel learned that she was on
her way to see her grandmother, the squirrel said, "But you have to be very,
very careful! The Big Bad Wolf is looking for you and he says that he will
lick your titties! Little Red told the squirrel, "I'm not afraid, besides, I
have a gun in my basket!" A little further down the trail, Red came across a
rabbit. The rabbit told her the same thing. "Don't go to your grandmothers
house, because the Big Bad Wolf will be waiting for you and he wants to lick
your titties!" Little Red told the rabbit, "I'm not afraid, besides, I have
a gun in my basket!" Little Red Riding Hood skipped on down the forest trail.
When she got to her grandmother's house she met the Big Bad Wolf. He said,
"Hello there, Red! I'm glad you are here, because I'm going to lick your

Yesterday I looked out my backyard into my neighbor's backyard and I saw a
penguin walking around the yard. So, I called my neighbor and said, "Do you
know that you have a penguin in your back yard?" He said, "Yes, I know; what
do you think I should do about it?" I said, "Why don't you take it to the
zoo." The next day I looked out my backyard again and the penguin was still
in my neighbor's backyard, so I called him up again and said, "Hey, I thought
you took that penguin to the zoo?" He said, "I did, and we had so much fun
that today I am taking him to the beach ..."

An engineer, a physicist, and a lawyer were being interviewed for a posi-
tion as chief executive officer of a large corporation. The engineer was
interviewed first, and was asked a long list of questions, ending with "How
much is two plus two?" The engineer excused himself, and made a series of
measurements and calculations before returning to the board room and
announcing, "Four." The physicist was interviewed next, and was asked the
same questions. Before answering the last question, he excused himself,
made for the library, and did a great deal of research. After a consulta-
tion with the United States Bureau of Standards, and many calculations, he
also announced "Four." The lawyer was interviewed last, and was asked the
same questions. At the end of his interview, before answering the last
question, he drew all the shades in the room, looked outside the door to
see if anyone was there, checked the telephone for listening devices, and
asked, "How much do you want it to be?"

Following a distinguished legal career, a man arrived at the Gates of
Heaven, accompanied by the Pope, who had the misfortune to expire on the
same day. The Pope was greeted first by St. Peter, who escorted him to
his quarters. The room was somewhat shabby and small, similar to that
found in a low-grade Motel 6-type establishment. The lawyer was then
taken to his room, which was a palacial suite including a private
swimming pool, a garden, and a terrace overlooking the Gates. The
attorney was somehwat taken aback, and told St. Peter, "I'm really
quite surprised at these rooms, seeing as how the Pope was given such
small accomodations." St. Peter replied, "We have over a hundred Popes
here, and we're really very bored with them. We've never had a lawyer."
